  Determined helps deep learning teams train models more quickly, easily share
  GPU resources, and effectively collaborate. Determined allows deep learning
  engineers to focus on building and training models at scale, without needing
  to worry about DevOps or writing custom code for common tasks like fault
  tolerance or experiment tracking.You can think of Determined as a platform
  that bridges the gap between tools like TensorFlow and PyTorch --- which work
  great for a single researcher with a single GPU --- to the challenges that
  arise when doing deep learning at scale, as teams, clusters, and data sets all
  increase in size. ~ https://docs.determined.ai/0.24.0/rest-api/index.html

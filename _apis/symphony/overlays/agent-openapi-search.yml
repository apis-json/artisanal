        Sends a message to be imported into the system.

        Allows you to override the timestamp and author of the message with your
        desired values.

        The requesting user must have the Content Management role.

        The user that the message is intended to have come from must also be
        present in the conversation.

        The intended message timestamp must be a valid time from the past. It
        cannot be a future timestamp.

        Optionally the original message ID can be specified to identify the
        imported message for the purpose of repeat imports.

        Post a new message to the given list of streams. The stream can be a
        chatroom,

        an IM or a multiparty IM.


        You may include an attachment on the message.


        The message can be provided as MessageMLV2 or PresentationML. Both
        formats support Freemarker templates.


        The optional parameter "data" can be used to provide a JSON payload
        containing entity data.

        If the message contains explicit references to entity data (in
        "data-entity-id" element attributes),

        this parameter is required.


        If the message is in MessageML and fails schema validation a client
        error results


        This endpoint is idempotent, it means that a 200 response will be
        returned even if the message has not been

        delivered to some streams. Check the `errors` map from the response in
        order to see on which stream(s) the

        message has not been delivered.


        The maximum number of streams where the message can be sent is limitted
        to 100.


        Regarding authentication, you must either use the sessionToken which was
        created for delegated app access

        or both the sessionToken and keyManagerToken together.

         "streamId", "streamType".
         "text" search requires a "streamId" to be specified.
         "streamType" accepts one of the following values: "chat" (IMs and MIMs), "im", "mim", "chatroom", "post".
         "signal" queries can only be combined with "fromDate", "toDate", "skip" and "limit" parameters.

      description: |
        A caller can fetch all unseen messages by passing the timestamp of
        the last message seen as the since parameter and the number of messages
        with the same timestamp value already seen as the skip parameter. This
        means that every message will be seen exactly once even in the case that
        an additional message is processed with the same timestamp as the last
        message returned by the previous call, and the case where there are
        more than maxMessages with the same timestamp value.

        This method is intended for historic queries and is generally reliable
        but if guaranteed delivery of every message in real time is required
        then the equivilent firehose method should be called.

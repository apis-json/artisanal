        This is the only API call that does not require you to use the
        "X-Bunq-Client-Authentication" and "X-Bunq-Client-Signature" headers.
         You provide the server with the public part of the key pair that you are going to use to create the value of the signature header for all future API calls. The server creates an installation for you. Store the Installation Token and ServerPublicKey from the response. This token is used in the "X-Bunq-Client-Authentication" header for the creation of a DeviceServer and SessionServer.

        <p>When you get a dispute, contacting your customer is always the best
        first step. If that doesn’t work, you can submit evidence to help us
        resolve the dispute in your favor. You can do this in your <a
        href="https://dashboard.stripe.com/disputes">dashboard</a>, but if you
        prefer, you can use the API to submit evidence programmatically.</p>


        <p>Depending on your dispute type, different evidence fields will give
        you a better chance of winning your dispute. To figure out which
        evidence fields to provide, see our <a
        href="/docs/disputes/categories">guide to dispute types</a>.</p>

        <p>Closing the dispute for a charge indicates that you do not have any
        evidence to submit and are essentially dismissing the dispute,
        acknowledging it as lost.</p>


        <p>The status of the dispute will change from
        <code>needs_response</code> to <code>lost</code>. <em>Closing a dispute
        is irreversible</em>.</p>

        <p>Client-side retrieval using a publishable key is allowed when the

        <p>When retrieved with a publishable key, only a subset of properties

    post:

        <p>You can cancel a SetupIntent object when it’s in one of these
        statuses: <code>requires_payment_method</code>,
        <code>requires_confirmation</code>, or <code>requires_action</code>.
        </p>


        <p>After you cancel it, setup is abandoned and any operations on the
        SetupIntent fail with an error.</p>
  /v1/setup_intents/{intent}/confirm:
    post:
      description: >-
        <p>Confirm that your customer intends to set up the current or

        provided payment method. For example, you would confirm a SetupIntent

        when a customer hits the “Save” button on a payment method management

        page on your website.</p>


        <p>If the selected payment method does not require any additional

        steps from the customer, the SetupIntent will transition to the

        <code>succeeded</code> status.</p>


        <p>Otherwise, it will transition to the <code>requires_action</code>
        status and

        suggest additional actions via <code>next_action</code>. If setup fails,

        the SetupIntent will transition to the

        <code>requires_payment_method</code> status or the <code>canceled</code>
        status if the

        confirmation limit is reached.</p>

      Tokenization is the process Stripe uses to collect sensitive card or bank
      account details, or personally identifiable information (PII), directly
      from your customers in a secure manner. A token representing this
      information is returned to your server to use. Use our recommended
      payments integrations to perform this process on the client-side. This
      guarantees that no sensitive card data touches your server, and allows
      your integration to operate in a PCI-compliant way.

      Stripe Treasury is a banking-as-a-service API that lets you embed
      financial services in your product. With Stripe’s API, you can enable
      businesses to hold funds, pay bills, earn yield, and manage their cash
      flow. Many users build Stripe Issuing in conjunction with Stripe Treasury
      to attach cards to spend funds in the account.

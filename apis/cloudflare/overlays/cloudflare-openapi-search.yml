        ### Purge All Cached Content

        Removes ALL files from Cloudflare's cache. All tiers can purge
        everything.


        ### Purge Cached Content by URL

        Granularly removes one or more files from Cloudflare's cache by
        specifying URLs. All tiers can purge by URL.


        To purge files with custom cache keys, include the headers used to
        compute the cache key as in the example. If you have a device type or
        geo in your cache key, you will need to include the CF-Device-Type or
        CF-IPCountry headers. If you have lang in your cache key, you will need
        to include the Accept-Language header.


        **NB:** When including the Origin header, be sure to include the
        **scheme** and **hostname**. The port number can be omitted if it is the
        default port (80 for http, 443 for https), but must be included
        otherwise.


        ### Purge Cached Content by Tag, Host or Prefix

        Granularly removes one or more files from Cloudflare's cache either by
        specifying the host, the associated Cache-Tag, or a Prefix. Only
        Enterprise customers are permitted to purge by Tag, Host or Prefix.


        **NB:** Cache-Tag, host, and prefix purging each have a rate limit of
        30,000 purge API calls in every 24 hour period. You may purge up to 30
        tags, hosts, or prefixes in one API call. This rate limit can be raised
        for customers who need to purge at higher volume.

        won't see the SSE tags in your HTML source when it's served through

        The `/received` api route allows customers to retrieve their edge HTTP

        minute M", where the minute M refers to the time records were received
        at Cloudflare's central data center. `start` is inclusive, and `end` is
        exclusive. Because of that, to get all data, at minutely cadence,
        starting at 10AM, the proper values are:
        `start=2018-05-20T10:00:00Z&end=2018-05-20T10:01:00Z`, then
        `start=2018-05-20T10:01:00Z&end=2018-05-20T10:02:00Z` and so on; the
        overlap will be handled properly.

Keep in mind that the waiting room page will only be displayed if `force_queue=true` or `event=prequeueing` — for other cases the request will pass through to the origin. For our preview, this will be a fake origin website returning \"Welcome\". \n\t- **reject** indicates a Reject queue.\n4. `event`: Used to preview a waiting room event.\n\t- **none** indicates no event is occurring.\n\t- **prequeueing** indicates that an event is prequeueing (between `prequeue_start_time` and `event_start_time`).\n\t- **started** indicates that an event has started (between `event_start_time` and `event_end_time`).\n5. `shuffle_at_event_start`: Boolean indicating if the event will shuffle users in the prequeue when it starts.

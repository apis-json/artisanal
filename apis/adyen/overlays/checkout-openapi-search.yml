        The endpoint returns the Apple Pay session data which you need to
        complete the [Apple Pay session

        the request asynchronously, in a [**TECHNICAL_CANCEL**
        webhook](https://docs.adyen.com/online-payments/cancel#cancellation-webhook).


        If you want to cancel a payment using the
        [`pspReference`](https://docs.adyen.com/api-explorer/#/CheckoutService/latest/post/payments__resParam_pspReference),
        use the
        [`/payments/{paymentPspReference}/cancels`](https://docs.adyen.com/api-explorer/#/CheckoutService/latest/post/payments/{paymentPspReference}/cancels)
        endpoint instead.


        If you want to cancel a payment but are not sure whether it has been
        captured, use the
        [`/payments/{paymentPspReference}/reversals`](https://docs.adyen.com/api-explorer/#/CheckoutService/latest/post/payments/{paymentPspReference}/reversals)

        supported
        brands](https://docs.adyen.com/api-explorer/#/CheckoutService/latest/post/cardDetails__reqParam_supportedBrands)
        in the request, the response also tells you if you support each [brand
        that was
        identified](https://docs.adyen.com/api-explorer/#/CheckoutService/latest/post/cardDetails__resParam_details).


        If you have an API-only integration and collect card data, use this
        endpoint to find out if the shopper's card is co-branded. For co-branded
        cards, you must let the shopper choose the brand to pay with  if you
        support both brands.

        submitted to `/payments`).


        Although we highly recommend using this endpoint to ensure you are
        always offering the most up-to-date list of payment methods, its usage
        is optional. You can, for example, also cache the `/paymentMethods`
        response and update it once a week.

         Captures an authorised payment and returns a unique reference for this request. You get the outcome of the request asynchronously, in a [**CAPTURE** webhook](https://docs.adyen.com/online-payments/capture#capture-notification).

        You can capture either the full authorised amount or a part of the
        authorised amount. By default, any unclaimed amount after a partial
        capture gets cancelled. This does not apply if you enabled multiple
        partial captures on your account and the payment method supports
        multiple partial captures. 


        [Automatic
        capture](https://docs.adyen.com/online-payments/capture#automatic-capture)
        is the default setting for most payment methods. In these cases, you
        don't need to make capture requests. However, making capture requests
        for payments that are captured automatically does not result in double
        charges.


        For more information, refer to

        [iDEAL](https://docs.adyen.com/payment-methods/ideal), or
        [Klarna](https://docs.adyen.com/payment-methods/klarna).

        endpoint instead.

        [Refunds](https://docs.adyen.com/api-explorer/#/CheckoutService/latest/post/payments/{paymentPspReference}/refunds)
        a payment if it has already been captured, and
        [cancels](https://docs.adyen.com/api-explorer/#/CheckoutService/latest/post/payments/{paymentPspReference}/cancels)
        a payment if it has not yet been captured. Returns a unique reference
        for this request. You get the outcome of the request asynchronously, in
        a [**CANCEL_OR_REFUND**
        webhook](https://docs.adyen.com/online-payments/reverse#cancel-or-refund-webhook).


        The reversed amount is always the full payment amount.

        > Do not use this request for payments that involve multiple partial
        captures.

        Creates a payment session for [Web

        Components](https://docs.adyen.com/online-payments/web-components)
        integrations.


        The response contains encrypted payment session data. The front end then
        uses the session data to make any required server-side calls for the
        payment flow.


        You get the payment outcome asynchronously, in an
        [AUTHORISATION](https://docs.adyen.com/api-explorer/#/Webhooks/latest/post/AUTHORISATION)
        webhook.

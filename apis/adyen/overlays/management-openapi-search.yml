      description: >-
        Sends sample notifications to test if the webhook is set up correctly.


        We send sample notifications for maximum 20 of the merchant accounts
        that the webhook is configured for. If the webhook is configured for
        more than 20 merchant accounts, use the `merchantIds` array to specify a
        subset of the merchant accounts for which to send test notifications.


        We send four test notifications for each event code you choose. They
        cover success and failure scenarios for the hard-coded currencies EUR
        and GBP, regardless of the currencies configured in the merchant
        accounts. For custom notifications, we only send the specified custom
        notification.


        The response describes the result of the test. The `status` field tells
        you if the test was successful or not. You can use the other response
        fields to troubleshoot unsuccessful tests.

      summary: Add a payout setting
      description: >-
        Sends a request to add a payout setting for the merchant account
        specified in the path. A payout setting links the merchant account to
        the [transfer
        instrument](https://docs.adyen.com/api-explorer/#/legalentity/latest/post/transferInstruments)
        that contains the details of the payout bank account. Adyen verifies the
        bank account before allowing and enabling the payout setting.


        If you're accepting payments in multiple currencies, you may add
        multiple payout settings for the merchant account.


        Use this endpoint if your integration requires it, such as Adyen for
        Platforms Manage. Your Adyen contact will set up your access.

      summary: Test a webhook
      description: >-
        Sends sample notifications to test if the webhook is set up correctly.


        We send four test notifications for each event code you choose. They
        cover success and failure scenarios for the hard-coded currencies EUR
        and GBP, regardless of the currencies configured in the merchant
        accounts. For custom notifications, we only send the specified custom
        notification.


        The response describes the result of the test. The `status` field tells
        you if the test was successful or not. You can use the other fields to
        troubleshoot unsuccessful tests.

        The following restrictions apply:

        * You can schedule only one action at a time. For example, to install a
        new app version and remove an old app version, you have to make two API
        requests. 

        * The maximum number of terminals in a request is **100**. For example,
        to apply an action to 250 terminals, you have to divide the terminals
        over three API requests. 

        * If there is an error with one or more terminal IDs in the request, the
        action is scheduled for none of the terminals. You need to fix the error
        and try again.

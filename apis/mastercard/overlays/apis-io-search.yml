  - name: Mastercard Automatic Billing Updater API
    description: >-
      Automatic Billing Updater (ABU) is a web service that provides access to
      updated account credentials (cards). This can be leveraged by
      Merchant/Acquirers/Payment Service Providers to ensure that they always
      have their customers’ most up to date card credentials on file; the main
      benefit being a big reduction in declines for recurring and card-on-file
      payments. This service can be used in two different ways, either pulling
      updates or having updates pushed to an endpoint on the
      Merchant/Acquirers/Payment Service Provider’s system for account numbers
      that they are watching.

        Authorize a user by sending them through the [Box](https://box.com)
        website and request their permission to act on their behalf.

        This is the first step when authenticating a user using
        OAuth 2.0. To request a user's authorization to use the Box APIs
        on their behalf you will need to send a user to the URL with this
        format.

      description: |-
        Request an Access Token using either a client-side obtained OAuth 2.0
        authorization code or a server-side JWT assertion.

        An Access Token is a string that enables Box to verify that a
        request belongs to an authorized session. In the normal order of
        operations you will begin by requesting authentication from the
        [authorize](#get-authorize) endpoint and Box will send you an
        authorization code.

        You will then send this code to this endpoint to exchange it for
        an Access Token. The returned Access Token can then be used to to make
        Box API calls.

        Promote a specific version of a file.

        If previous versions exist, this method can be used to
        promote one of the older versions to the top of the version history.

        This creates a new copy of the old version and puts it at the
        top of the versions history. The file will have the exact same contents
        as the older version, with the the same hash digest, `etag`, and
        name as the original.

        Other properties such as comments do not get updated to their
        former values.

        Don't use this endpoint to restore Box Notes,
        as it works with file formats such as PDF, DOC,
        PPTX or similar.

        applied to the file before. When editing metadata, only values that

        the metadata template schema will be accepted.

        The metadata instance can only be updated if the template has already
        been

        applied to the folder before. When editing metadata, only values that
        match

        the metadata template schema will be accepted.

        application of the operations, the metadata instance will not be
        changed.

        Adds a collaboration for a single user or a single group to a file
        or folder.

        Collaborations can be created using email address, user IDs, or a
        group IDs.

        If a collaboration is being created with a group, access to
        this endpoint is dependent on the group's ability to be invited.

        If collaboration is in `pending` status, the following fields
        are redacted:
        - `login` and `name` are hidden if a collaboration was created
        using `user_id`,
        -  `name` is hidden if a collaboration was created using `login`.

        Returns the file represented by a shared link.

        A shared file can be represented by a shared link,
        which can originate within the current enterprise or within another.

        This endpoint allows an application to retrieve information about a
        shared file when only given a shared link.

        The `shared_link_permission_options` array field can be returned
        by requesting it in the `fields` query parameter.

        Return the folder represented by a shared link.

        A shared folder can be represented by a shared link,
        which can originate within the current enterprise or within another.

        This endpoint allows an application to retrieve information about a
        shared folder when only given a shared link.

        A shared web link can be represented by a shared link,
        which can originate within the current enterprise or within another.

        This endpoint allows an application to retrieve information about a
        shared web link when only given a shared link.

        In the case of a client-side authenticated OAuth 2.0 application

        this will be the user who authorized the app.


        In the case of a JWT, server-side authenticated application

        by default.

        Move all of the items (files, folders and workflows) owned by a user
        into

        another user's account


        Only the root folder (`0`) can be transferred.


        Folders can only be moved across users by users with administrative

        permissions.


        All existing shared links and folder-level collaborations are
        transferred

        during the operation. Please note that while collaborations at the
        individual

        file-level are transferred during the operation, the collaborations are

        deleted when the original user is deleted.


        This call will be performed synchronously which might lead to a slow
        response

        when the source user has a large number of items in all of its folders.


        If the destination path has a metadata cascade policy attached to any of

        the parent folders, a metadata cascade operation will be kicked off

        asynchronously.


        There is currently no way to check for when this operation is finished.


        The destination folder's name will be in the format `{User}'s Files and

        Folders`, where `{User}` is the display name of the user.


        To make this API call your application will need to have the "Read and
        write

        all files and folders stored in Box" scope enabled.


        Please make sure the destination user has access to `Relay` or `Relay
        Lite`,

        and has access to the files and folders involved in the workflows being

        transferred.


        Admins will receive an email when the operation is completed.

        Invites an existing external user to join an enterprise.

        The existing user can not be part of another enterprise and
        must already have a Box account. Once invited, the user will receive an
        email and are prompted to accept the invitation within the
        Box web application.

        This method requires the "Manage An Enterprise" scope enabled for
        the application, which can be enabled within the developer console.

        This API only returns webhooks that are applied to files or folders that
        are

        owned by the authenticated user. This means that an admin can not see
        webhooks

        created by a service account unless the admin has access to those
        folders, and

        vice versa.

        Returns a list of real-time servers that can be used for long-polling
        updates

        to the [event stream](#get-events).


        Long polling is the concept where a HTTP request is kept open until the

        server sends a response, then repeating the process over and over to
        receive

        updated responses.


        Long polling the event stream can only be used for user events, not for

        enterprise events.


        To use long polling, first use this endpoint to retrieve a list of long
        poll

        URLs. Next, make a long poll request to any of the provided URLs.


        When an event occurs in monitored account a response with the value

        `new_change` will be sent. The response contains no other details as

        it only serves as a prompt to take further action such as sending a

        request to the [events endpoint](#get-events) with the last known

        `stream_position`.


        After the server sends this response it closes the connection. You must
        now

        repeat the long poll process to begin listening for events again.


        If no events occur for a while and the connection times out you will

        receive a response with the value `reconnect`. When you receive this
        response

        you’ll make another call to this endpoint to restart the process.


        If you receive no events in `retry_timeout` seconds then you will need
        to

        make another request to the real-time server (one of the URLs in the
        response

        for this endpoint). This might be necessary due to network errors.


        Finally, if you receive a `max_retries` error when making a request to
        the

        real-time server, you should start over by making a call to this
        endpoint

        first.

        Returns up to a year of past events for a given user

        By default this returns events for the authenticated user. To retrieve
        events

        for the entire enterprise, set the `stream_type` to
        `admin_logs_streaming`

        for live monitoring of new events, or `admin_logs` for querying across

        historical events. The user making the API call will

        need to have admin privileges, and the application will need to have the

        scope `manage enterprise properties` checked.

        Get a list of current file versions for a legal hold

        assignment.


        In some cases you may want to get previous file versions instead. In
        these

        cases, use the `GET 
        /legal_hold_policy_assignments/:id/file_versions_on_hold`

        API instead to return any previous versions of a file for this legal
        hold

        policy assignment.


        Due to ongoing re-architecture efforts this API might not return all
        file

        versions held for this policy ID. Instead, this API will only return the

        latest file version held in the newly developed architecture. The `GET

        /file_version_legal_holds` API can be used to fetch current and past
        versions

        of files held within the legacy architecture.


        The `GET /legal_hold_policy_assignments?policy_id={id}` API can be used
        to

        find a list of policy assignments for a given policy ID.

        In some cases you may only need the latest file versions instead. In

        instead to return any current (latest) versions of a file for this legal
        hold

        Get a list of file versions on legal hold for a legal hold

        assignment.


        Due to ongoing re-architecture efforts this API might not return all
        file

        versions for this policy ID.


        Instead, this API will only return file versions held in the legacy

        architecture. Two new endpoints will available to request any file
        versions

        held in the new architecture.


        For file versions held in the new architecture, the `GET

        /legal_hold_policy_assignments/:id/file_versions_on_hold` API can be
        used to

        return all past file versions available for this policy assignment, and
        the

        `GET /legal_hold_policy_assignments/:id/files_on_hold` API can be used
        to

        return any current (latest) versions of a file under legal hold.


        The `GET /legal_hold_policy_assignments?policy_id={id}` API can be used
        to

        find a list of policy assignments for a given policy ID.


        Once the re-architecture is completed this API will be deprecated.

      description: >-
        Creates a request to download multiple files and folders as a single
        `zip`

        archive file. This API does not return the archive but instead performs
        all

        the checks to ensure that the user has access to all the items, and then

        returns a `download_url` and a `status_url` that can be used to download
        the

        archive.


        The limit for an archive is either the Account's upload limit or

        10,000 files, whichever is met first.


        **Note**: Downloading a large file can be

        affected by various

        factors such as distance, network latency,

        bandwidth, and congestion, as well as packet loss

        ratio and current server load.

        For these reasons we recommend that a maximum ZIP archive

        total size does not exceed 25GB.

        Returns the contents of a `zip` archive in binary format. This URL does
        not

        require any form of authentication and could be used in a user's browser
        to

        download the archive to a user's device.


        By default, this URL is only valid for a few seconds from the creation
        of

        the request for this archive. Once a download has started it can not be

        stopped and resumed, instead a new request for a zip archive would need
        to

        be created.


        The URL of this endpoint should not be considered as fixed. Instead, use

        the [Create zip download](e://post_zip_downloads) API to request to
        create a

        `zip` archive, and then follow the `download_url` field in the response

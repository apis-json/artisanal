        In most cases only values that are present in the metadata template

        will be accepted, except for the `global.properties` template which
        accepts

        any key-value pair.

        The metadata instance can only be updated if the template has already
        been

        applied to the file before. When editing metadata, only values that
        match

        the metadata template schema will be accepted.


        The update is applied atomically. If any errors occur during the

        application of the operations, the metadata instance will not be
        changed.

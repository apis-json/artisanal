  description: "The REST APIs have been around for a longer time compared to GraphQL
    APIs, which may make them more familiar to some developers. It is often a good
    choice for developers who are more comfortable with traditional API architecture.\n\n"

- name: GitLab GraphQL API
  description: GraphQL is a query language for APIs. You can use it to request the
    exact data you need, and therefore limit the number of requests you need. GraphQL
    data is arranged in types, so your client can use client-side GraphQL libraries
    to consume the API and avoid manual parsing. There are no fixed endpoints and
    no data model, so you can add to the API without creating breaking changes. This
    enables us to have a versionless API.

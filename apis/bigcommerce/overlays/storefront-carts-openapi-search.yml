        If a modified product or variant needs to be changed or updated, you can
        remove and re-add the product to the cart with the correct variants
        using the [Delete Cart Line
        Item](/docs/rest-storefront/carts/cart-items#delete-cart-line-item) and
        the [Add Cart Line
        Items](/docs/rest-storefront/carts/cart-items#add-cart-line-items)
        endpoints. You can also use carts mutations that are part of the
        [GraphQL Storefront
        API](/docs/storefront/cart-checkout/guide/graphql-storefront).

description: >-
  Okta connects any person with any application on any device. It's an
  enterprise-grade, identity management service, built for the cloud, but
  compatible with many on-premises applications. With Okta, IT can manage any
  employee's access to any application or device. Okta runs in the cloud, on a
  secure, reliable, extensively audited platform, which integrates deeply with
  on-premises applications, directories, and identity management systems.

      The Core Okta API is the primary way that apps and services interact with
      Okta. You can use it to implement basic auth functions such as signing in
      your users and programmatically managing your Okta objects.

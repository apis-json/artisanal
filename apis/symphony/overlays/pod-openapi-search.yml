      description: >
        The returned data is taken from the in-memory cache for performance

        reasons which means inactive users may be omitted from the response.


        All non-inactive users WILL be returned and some inactive users MAY

        be included. Any omitted user IS inactive.


        Returned records are sorted by user ID, ascending.


        This method is expensive. It pulls ALL records from the cache, sorts
        them and then only uses a subset.

        For large numbers of users, this can be very inefficient both due to
        sorting

        and due to the cache being distributed across many nodes.


        Addiionally, there is the potential to miss users if they become active

        after the page in which their user ID falls has already been read by the
        client.

        To avoid this situation, a presence feed should be created (and
        optionally read from)

        first to capture presence changes of users who get reactivated during a
        paged call to this endpoint.

      summary: Allows iteration of all file extensions supported for upload
      description: >
        Provides a RESTful API to iterate all file extensions configured by the
        tenant admin

        that are allowed for the upload.  Pagination of this list is managed
        through a

        combination of the optional request parameters and service-side managed
        maximums.


        Pagination of the results is provided through the before or after input
        paramters

        and presented through the opaque cursor values provided as output from a
        previous

        response.  Only one of before or after or neither may be provided.


        DO NOT store cursors. Cursors can quickly become invalid if items are
        added or deleted.

        Use them only during a short-period of time that you are traversing the
        list.

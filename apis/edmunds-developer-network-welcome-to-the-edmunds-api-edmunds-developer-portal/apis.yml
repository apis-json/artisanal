  To access Edmunds content, REST APIs are used to retrieve a JSON data object
  that contains a rich set of content elements that can be parsed and integrated
  into your website. The APIs are located at a web address that begins with
  https://api.edmunds.com/ and ends with a text string containing the API key
  provided for your dealership. It is important that every URL you construct
  contains this key string otherwise no content will be returned ~

    description: >+
      The REST APIs have been around for a longer time compared to GraphQL APIs,
      which may make them more familiar to some developers. It is often a good
      choice for developers who are more comfortable with traditional API
      architecture.

    description: >-
      GraphQL is a query language for APIs. You can use it to request the exact
      data you need, and therefore limit the number of requests you need.
      GraphQL data is arranged in types, so your client can use client-side
      GraphQL libraries to consume the API and avoid manual parsing. There are
      no fixed endpoints and no data model, so you can add to the API without
      creating breaking changes. This enables us to have a versionless API.

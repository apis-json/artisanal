name: Image API 3.0 — IIIF | International Image Interoperability Framework
description: >-
  This document describes an image delivery API defined by the International
  Image Interoperability Framework (IIIF, pronounced “Triple-Eye-Eff”)
  Consortium. The IIIF Image API specifies a web service that returns an image
  in response to a standard HTTP or HTTPS request. The URI can specify the
  region, size, rotation, quality characteristics and format of the requested
  image. A URI can also be constructed to request basic technical information
  about the image to support client applications. This API was conceived of to
  facilitate systematic reuse of image resources in digital image repositories
  maintained by cultural heritage organizations. It could be adopted by any
  image repository or service, and can be used to retrieve static images in
  response to a properly constructed URI. ~ https://iiif.io/api/image/3.0/

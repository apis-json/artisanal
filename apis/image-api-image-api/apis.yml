  Image transformations are real-time image manipulation and optimization
  features of the Delivery API that speeds up image delivery. The Image API will
  process images up to 25Mb in size, images larger than this are not processed.
  As Contensis caches the results of image transformations, you can retrieve the
  adjusted images even faster the next time you need them. ~

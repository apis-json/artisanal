        the same contactId that was created by BatchPutContact. </p>

        quota of 99 phone numbers, and in any 30 day period you release 99,
        claim 99, and then release 99, you will have exceeded the 200% limit. At
        that point you are blocked from claiming any more numbers until you open
        an Amazon Web Services support ticket.</p>

        API. It provides more flexibility, features, and the ability to query
        longer time ranges than <code>GetMetricData</code>. Use it to retrieve
        historical agent and contact metrics for the last 3 months, at varying
        intervals. You can also use it to build custom dashboards to measure
        historical queue and agent performance. For example, you can track the
        number of incoming contacts for the last 7 days, with data split by day,
        to see how contact volume changed per day of the week.</p> </note>

        <p>Stops recording a call when a contact is being recorded.
        StopContactRecording is a one-time action. If you use
        StopContactRecording to stop recording an ongoing call, you can't use
        StartContactRecording to restart it. For scenarios where the recording
        has started and you want to suspend it for sensitive information (for
        example, to collect a credit card number), and then restart it, use
        SuspendContactRecording and ResumeContactRecording.</p> <p>Only voice
        recordings are supported at this time.</p>

      description: >-
        <p>Transfers contacts from one agent or queue to another agent or queue
        at any point after a contact is created. You can transfer a contact to
        another queue by providing the flow which orchestrates the contact to
        the destination queue. This gives you more control over contact handling
        and helps you adhere to the service level agreement (SLA) guaranteed to
        your customers.</p> <p>Note the following requirements:</p> <ul> <li>
        <p>Transfer is supported for only <code>TASK</code> contacts.</p> </li>
        <li> <p>Do not use both <code>QueueId</code> and <code>UserId</code> in
        the same call.</p> </li> <li> <p>The following flow types are supported:
        Inbound flow, Transfer to agent flow, and Transfer to queue flow.</p>
        </li> <li> <p>The <code>TransferContact</code> API can be called only on
        active contacts.</p> </li> <li> <p>A contact cannot be transferred more
        than 11 times.</p> </li> </ul>

      summary: UpdateContactRoutingData
      description: >-
        <p>This API is in preview release for Amazon Connect and is subject to
        change.</p> <p>Updates routing priority and age on the contact
        (<b>QueuePriority</b> and <b>QueueTimeAdjustmentInSeconds</b>). These
        properties can be used to change a customer's position in the queue. For
        example, you can move a contact to the back of the queue by setting a
        lower routing priority relative to other contacts in queue; or you can
        move a contact to the front of the queue by increasing the routing age
        which will make the contact look artificially older and therefore higher
        up in the first-in-first-out routing order. Note that adjusting the
        routing age of a contact affects only its position in queue, and not its
        actual queue wait time as reported through metrics. These properties can
        also be updated by using <a
        href="https://docs.aws.amazon.com/connect/latest/adminguide/change-routing-priority.html">the
        Set routing priority / age flow block</a>.</p>

        phone number is claimed to a traffic distribution group that was created
        in the same Region as the Amazon Connect instance where you are calling
        this API, then you can use a full phone number ARN or a UUID for
        <code>OutboundCallerIdNumberId</code>. However, if the phone number is
        claimed to a traffic distribution group that is in one Region, and you
        are calling this API from an instance in another Amazon Web Services
        Region that is associated with the traffic distribution group, you must

      summary: UpdateUserIdentityInfo
      description: >-
        <p>Updates the identity information for the specified user.</p>
        <important> <p>We strongly recommend limiting who has the ability to
        invoke <code>UpdateUserIdentityInfo</code>. Someone with that ability
        can change the login credentials of other users by changing their email
        address. This poses a security risk to your organization. They can
        change the email address of a user to the attacker's email address, and
        then reset the password through email. For more information, see <a
        href="https://docs.aws.amazon.com/connect/latest/adminguide/security-profile-best-practices.html">Best
        Practices for Security Profiles</a> in the <i>Amazon Connect
        Administrator Guide</i>.</p> </important>

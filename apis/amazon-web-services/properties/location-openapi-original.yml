      summary: BatchEvaluateGeofences
      description: >-
        <p>Evaluates device positions against the geofence geometries from a
        given geofence collection.</p> <p>This operation always returns an empty
        response because geofences are asynchronously evaluated. The evaluation
        determines if the device has entered or exited a geofenced area, and
        then publishes one of the following events to Amazon EventBridge:</p>
        <ul> <li> <p> <code>ENTER</code> if Amazon Location determines that the
        tracked device has entered a geofenced area.</p> </li> <li> <p>
        <code>EXIT</code> if Amazon Location determines that the tracked device
        has exited a geofenced area.</p> </li> </ul> <note> <p>The last geofence
        that a device was observed within is tracked for 30 days after the most
        recent device position update.</p> </note> <note> <p>Geofence evaluation
        uses the given device position. It does not account for the optional
        <code>Accuracy</code> of a <code>DevicePositionUpdate</code>.</p>
        </note> <note> <p>The <code>DeviceID</code> is used as a string to
        represent the device. You do not need to have a <code>Tracker</code>
        associated with the <code>DeviceID</code>.</p> </note>

    POST:
      summary: BatchPutGeofence
      description: >-
        <p>A batch request for storing geofence geometries into a given geofence
        collection, or updates the geometry of an existing geofence if a
        geofence ID is included in the request.</p>
  /tracking/v0/trackers/{TrackerName}/positions:
    POST:
      summary: BatchUpdateDevicePosition
      description: >-
        <p>Uploads position update data for one or more devices to a tracker
        resource (up to 10 devices per batch). Amazon Location uses the data
        when it reports the last known device position and position history.
        Amazon Location retains location data for 30 days.</p> <note>
        <p>Position updates are handled based on the
        <code>PositionFiltering</code> property of the tracker. When
        <code>PositionFiltering</code> is set to <code>TimeBased</code>, updates
        are evaluated against linked geofence collections, and location data is
        stored at a maximum of one position per 30 second interval. If your
        update frequency is more often than every 30 seconds, only one update
        per 30 seconds is stored for each unique device ID.</p> <p>When
        <code>PositionFiltering</code> is set to <code>DistanceBased</code>
        filtering, location data is stored and evaluated against linked geofence
        collections only if the device has moved more than 30 m (98.4 ft).</p>
        <p>When <code>PositionFiltering</code> is set to
        <code>AccuracyBased</code> filtering, location data is stored and
        evaluated against linked geofence collections only if the device has
        moved more than the measured accuracy. For example, if two consecutive
        updates from a device have a horizontal accuracy of 5 m and 10 m, the
        second update is neither stored or evaluated if the device has moved
        less than 15 m. If <code>PositionFiltering</code> is set to
        <code>AccuracyBased</code> filtering, Amazon Location uses the default
        value <code>{ "Horizontal": 0}</code> when accuracy is not provided on a
        <code>DevicePositionUpdate</code>.</p> </note>

        routes from A to X, A to Y, B to X, and B to Y (in that order). The

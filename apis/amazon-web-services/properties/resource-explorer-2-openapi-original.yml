    <p>Amazon Web Services Resource Explorer is a resource search and discovery
    service. By using Resource Explorer, you can explore your resources using an
    internet search engine-like experience. Examples of resources include Amazon
    Relational Database Service (Amazon RDS) instances, Amazon Simple Storage
    Service (Amazon S3) buckets, or Amazon DynamoDB tables. You can search for
    your resources using resource metadata like names, tags, and IDs. Resource
    Explorer can search across all of the Amazon Web Services Regions in your
    account in which you turn the service on, to simplify your cross-Region
    workloads.</p> <p>Resource Explorer scans the resources in each of the
    Amazon Web Services Regions in your Amazon Web Services account in which you
    turn on Resource Explorer. Resource Explorer <a
    href="https://docs.aws.amazon.com/resource-explorer/latest/userguide/getting-started-terms-and-concepts.html#term-index">creates
    and maintains an index</a> in each Region, with the details of that Region's
    resources.</p> <p>You can <a
    href="https://docs.aws.amazon.com/resource-explorer/latest/userguide/manage-aggregator-region.html">search
    across all of the indexed Regions in your account</a> by designating one of
    your Amazon Web Services Regions to contain the aggregator index for the
    account. When you <a
    href="https://docs.aws.amazon.com/resource-explorer/latest/userguide/manage-aggregator-region-turn-on.html">promote
    a local index in a Region to become the aggregator index for the
    account</a>, Resource Explorer automatically replicates the index
    information from all local indexes in the other Regions to the aggregator
    index. Therefore, the Region with the aggregator index has a copy of all
    resource information for all Regions in the account where you turned on
    Resource Explorer. As a result, views in the aggregator index Region include
    resources from all of the indexed Regions in your account.</p> <p>For more
    information about Amazon Web Services Resource Explorer, including how to
    enable and configure the service, see the <a
    href="https://docs.aws.amazon.com/resource-explorer/latest/userguide/">Amazon
    Web Services Resource Explorer User Guide</a>.</p>

        Region in which you call this operation. When a user performs a
        <a>Search</a> that doesn't explicitly specify which view to use, then
        Amazon Web Services Resource Explorer automatically chooses this default
        view for searches performed in this Amazon Web Services Region.</p>
        <p>If an Amazon Web Services Region doesn't have a default view
        configured, then users must explicitly specify a view with every
        <code>Search</code> operation performed in that Region.</p>

        <p>Turns on Amazon Web Services Resource Explorer in the Amazon Web
        Services Region in which you called this operation by creating an index.
        Resource Explorer begins discovering the resources in this Region and
        stores the details about the resources in the index so that they can be
        queried by using the <a>Search</a> operation. You can create only one
        index in a Region.</p> <note> <p>This operation creates only a
        <i>local</i> index. To promote the local index in one Amazon Web
        Services Region into the aggregator index for the Amazon Web Services
        account, use the <a>UpdateIndexType</a> operation. For more information,
        see <a
        href="https://docs.aws.amazon.com/resource-explorer/latest/userguide/manage-aggregator-region.html">Turning
        on cross-Region search by creating an aggregator index</a> in the
        <i>Amazon Web Services Resource Explorer User Guide</i>.</p> </note>
        <p>For more details about what happens when you turn on Resource
        Explorer in an Amazon Web Services Region, see <a
        href="https://docs.aws.amazon.com/resource-explorer/latest/userguide/manage-service-activate.html">Turn
        on Resource Explorer to index your resources in an Amazon Web Services
        Region</a> in the <i>Amazon Web Services Resource Explorer User
        Guide</i>.</p> <p>If this is the first Amazon Web Services Region in
        which you've created an index for Resource Explorer, then this operation
        also <a
        href="https://docs.aws.amazon.com/resource-explorer/latest/userguide/security_iam_service-linked-roles.html">creates
        a service-linked role</a> in your Amazon Web Services account that
        allows Resource Explorer to enumerate your resources to populate the
        index.</p> <ul> <li> <p> <b>Action</b>:
        <code>resource-explorer-2:CreateIndex</code> </p> <p> <b>Resource</b>:
        The ARN of the index (as it will exist after the operation completes) in
        the Amazon Web Services Region and account in which you're trying to
        create the index. Use the wildcard character (<code>*</code>) at the end
        of the string to match the eventual UUID. For example, the following
        <code>Resource</code> element restricts the role or user to creating an
        index in only the <code>us-east-2</code> Region of the specified
        account.</p> <p> <code>"Resource":
        "arn:aws:resource-explorer-2:us-west-2:<i>&lt;account-id&gt;</i>:index/*"</code>
        </p> <p>Alternatively, you can use <code>"Resource": "*"</code> to allow
        the role or user to create an index in any Region.</p> </li> <li> <p>
        <b>Action</b>: <code>iam:CreateServiceLinkedRole</code> </p> <p>
        <b>Resource</b>: No specific resource (*). </p> <p>This permission is
        required only the first time you create an index to turn on Resource
        Explorer in the account. Resource Explorer uses this to create the <a
        href="https://docs.aws.amazon.com/resource-explorer/latest/userguide/security_iam_service-linked-roles.html">service-linked
        role needed to index the resources in your account</a>. Resource

        Resource Explorer in the specified Amazon Web Services Region. When you
        delete an index, Resource Explorer stops discovering and indexing
        resources in that Region. Resource Explorer also deletes all views in
        that Region. These actions occur as asynchronous background tasks. You
        can check to see when the actions are complete by using the

        value.</p> <note> <p>If the index you delete is the aggregator index for
        the Amazon Web Services account, you must wait 24 hours before you can

        <p> <b> <code>AGGREGATOR</code> index type</b> </p> <p>The index
        contains information about resources from all Amazon Web Services
        Regions in the Amazon Web Services account in which you've created a
        Resource Explorer index. Resource information from all other Regions is
        replicated to this Region's index.</p> <p>When you change the index type
        to <code>AGGREGATOR</code>, Resource Explorer turns on replication of
        all discovered resource information from the other Amazon Web Services
        Regions in your account to this index. You can then, from this Region
        only, perform resource search queries that span all Amazon Web Services
        Regions in the Amazon Web Services account. Turning on replication from
        all other Regions is performed by asynchronous background tasks. You can
        check the status of the asynchronous tasks by using the <a>GetIndex</a>
        operation. When the asynchronous tasks complete, the <code>Status</code>
        response of that operation changes from <code>UPDATING</code> to
        <code>ACTIVE</code>. After that, you can start to see results from other
        Amazon Web Services Regions in query results. However, it can take
        several hours for replication from all other Regions to complete.</p>
        <important> <p>You can have only one aggregator index per Amazon Web
        Services account. Before you can promote a different index to be the
        aggregator index for the account, you must first demote the existing
        aggregator index to type <code>LOCAL</code>.</p> </important> </li> <li>
        <p> <b> <code>LOCAL</code> index type</b> </p> <p>The index contains
        information about resources in only the Amazon Web Services Region in
        which the index exists. If an aggregator index in another Region exists,
        then information in this local index is replicated to the aggregator
        index.</p> <p>When you change the index type to <code>LOCAL</code>,
        Resource Explorer turns off the replication of resource information from
        all other Amazon Web Services Regions in the Amazon Web Services account
        to this Region. The aggregator index remains in the
        <code>UPDATING</code> state until all replication with other Regions
        successfully stops. You can check the status of the asynchronous task by
        using the <a>GetIndex</a> operation. When Resource Explorer successfully
        stops all replication with other Regions, the <code>Status</code>
        response of that operation changes from <code>UPDATING</code> to
        <code>ACTIVE</code>. Separately, the resource information from other
        Regions that was previously stored in the index is deleted within 30
        days by another background task. Until that asynchronous task completes,
        some results from other Regions can continue to appear in search
        results.</p> <important> <p>After you demote an aggregator index to a
        local index, you must wait 24 hours before you can promote another index
        to be the new aggregator index for the account.</p> </important> </li>

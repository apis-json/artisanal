        that was created by using one Amazon Web Services account with a private

    POST:
      summary: ChangeResourceRecordSets
      description: >-
        <p>Creates, changes, or deletes a resource record set, which contains
        authoritative DNS information for a specified domain name or subdomain
        name. For example, you can use <code>ChangeResourceRecordSets</code> to
        create a resource record set that routes traffic for test.example.com to
        a web server that has an IP address of 192.0.2.44.</p> <p> <b>Deleting
        Resource Record Sets</b> </p> <p>To delete a resource record set, you
        must specify all the same values that you specified when you created
        it.</p> <p> <b>Change Batches and Transactional Changes</b> </p> <p>The
        request body must include a document with a
        <code>ChangeResourceRecordSetsRequest</code> element. The request body
        contains a list of change items, known as a change batch. Change batches
        are considered transactional changes. Route 53 validates the changes in
        the request and then either makes all or none of the changes in the
        change batch request. This ensures that DNS routing isn't adversely
        affected by partial changes to the resource record sets in a hosted
        zone. </p> <p>For example, suppose a change batch request contains two
        changes: it deletes the <code>CNAME</code> resource record set for
        www.example.com and creates an alias resource record set for
        www.example.com. If validation for both records succeeds, Route 53
        deletes the first resource record set and creates the second resource
        record set in a single operation. If validation for either the
        <code>DELETE</code> or the <code>CREATE</code> action fails, then the
        request is canceled, and the original <code>CNAME</code> record
        continues to exist.</p> <note> <p>If you try to delete the same resource
        record set more than once in a single change batch, Route 53 returns an
        <code>InvalidChangeBatch</code> error.</p> </note> <p> <b>Traffic
        Flow</b> </p> <p>To create resource record sets for complex routing
        configurations, use either the traffic flow visual editor in the Route
        53 console or the API actions for traffic policies and traffic policy
        instances. Save the configuration as a traffic policy, then associate
        the traffic policy with one or more domain names (such as example.com)
        or subdomain names (such as www.example.com), in the same hosted zone or
        in multiple hosted zones. You can roll back the updates if the new
        configuration isn't performing as expected. For more information, see <a
        href="https://docs.aws.amazon.com/Route53/latest/DeveloperGuide/traffic-flow.html">Using
        Traffic Flow to Route DNS Traffic</a> in the <i>Amazon Route 53
        Developer Guide</i>.</p> <p> <b>Create, Delete, and Upsert</b> </p>
        <p>Use <code>ChangeResourceRecordsSetsRequest</code> to perform the
        following actions:</p> <ul> <li> <p> <code>CREATE</code>: Creates a
        resource record set that has the specified values.</p> </li> <li> <p>
        <code>DELETE</code>: Deletes an existing resource record set that has
        the specified values.</p> </li> <li> <p> <code>UPSERT</code>: If a
        resource set doesn't exist, Route 53 creates it. If a resource set
        exists Route 53 updates it with the values in the request. </p> </li>
        </ul> <p> <b>Syntaxes for Creating, Updating, and Deleting Resource
        Record Sets</b> </p> <p>The syntax for a request depends on the type of
        resource record set that you want to create, delete, or update, such as
        weighted, alias, or failover. The XML elements in your request must
        appear in the order listed in the syntax. </p> <p>For an example for
        each type of resource record set, see "Examples."</p> <p>Don't refer to
        the syntax in the "Parameter Syntax" section, which includes all of the
        elements for every kind of resource record set that you can create,
        delete, or update by using <code>ChangeResourceRecordSets</code>. </p>
        <p> <b>Change Propagation to Route 53 DNS Servers</b> </p> <p>When you
        submit a <code>ChangeResourceRecordSets</code> request, Route 53
        propagates your changes to all of the Route 53 authoritative DNS servers
        managing the hosted zone. While your changes are propagating,
        <code>GetChange</code> returns a status of <code>PENDING</code>. When
        propagation is complete, <code>GetChange</code> returns a status of
        <code>INSYNC</code>. Changes generally propagate to all Route 53 name
        servers managing the hosted zone within 60 seconds. For more
        information, see <a

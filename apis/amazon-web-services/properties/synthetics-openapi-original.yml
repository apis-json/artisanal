    <fullname>Amazon CloudWatch Synthetics</fullname> <p>You can use Amazon
    CloudWatch Synthetics to continually monitor your services. You can create
    and manage <i>canaries</i>, which are modular, lightweight scripts that
    monitor your endpoints and APIs from the outside-in. You can set up your
    canaries to run 24 hours a day, once per minute. The canaries help you check
    the availability and latency of your web services and troubleshoot anomalies
    by investigating load time data, screenshots of the UI, logs, and metrics.
    The canaries seamlessly integrate with CloudWatch ServiceLens to help you
    trace the causes of impacted nodes in your applications. For more
    information, see <a
    href="https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonCloudWatch/latest/monitoring/ServiceLens.html">Using
    ServiceLens to Monitor the Health of Your Applications</a> in the <i>Amazon
    CloudWatch User Guide</i>.</p> <p>Before you create and manage canaries, be
    aware of the security considerations. For more information, see <a

        and latency of your web services and troubleshoot anomalies by
        investigating load time data, screenshots of the UI, logs, and metrics.
        You can set up a canary to run continuously or just once. </p> <p>Do not
        use <code>CreateCanary</code> to modify an existing canary. Use <a
        href="https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonSynthetics/latest/APIReference/API_UpdateCanary.html">UpdateCanary</a>
        instead.</p> <p>To create canaries, you must have the
        <code>CloudWatchSyntheticsFullAccess</code> policy. If you are creating
        a new IAM role for the canary, you also need the
        <code>iam:CreateRole</code>, <code>iam:CreatePolicy</code> and
        <code>iam:AttachRolePolicy</code> permissions. For more information, see
        <a
        href="https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonCloudWatch/latest/monitoring/CloudWatch_Synthetics_Canaries_Roles">Necessary
        Roles and Permissions</a>.</p> <p>Do not include secrets or proprietary
        information in your canary names. The canary name makes up part of the
        Amazon Resource Name (ARN) for the canary, and the ARN is included in
        outbound calls over the internet. For more information, see <a

  /group:
    POST:
      summary: CreateGroup
      description: >-
        <p>Creates a group which you can use to associate canaries with each
        other, including cross-Region canaries. Using groups can help you with
        managing and automating your canaries, and you can also view aggregated
        run results and statistics for all canaries in a group. </p> <p>Groups
        are global resources. When you create a group, it is replicated across
        Amazon Web Services Regions, and you can view it and add canaries to it
        from any Region. Although the group ARN format reflects the Region name
        where it was created, a group is not constrained to any Region. This
        means that you can put canaries from multiple Regions into the same
        group, and then use that group to view and manage all of those canaries
        in a single view.</p> <p>Groups are supported in all Regions except the
        Regions that are disabled by default. For more information about these
        Regions, see <a
        href="https://docs.aws.amazon.com/general/latest/gr/rande-manage.html#rande-manage-enable">Enabling
        a Region</a>.</p> <p>Each group can contain as many as 10 canaries. You
        can have as many as 20 groups in your account. Any single canary can be
        a member of up to 10 groups.</p>

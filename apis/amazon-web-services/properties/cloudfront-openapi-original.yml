      description: >-
        <p>Associates an alias (also known as a CNAME or an alternate domain
        name) with a CloudFront distribution.</p> <p>With this operation you can
        move an alias that's already in use on a CloudFront distribution to a
        different distribution in one step. This prevents the downtime that
        could occur if you first remove the alias from one distribution and then
        separately add the alias to another distribution.</p> <p>To use this
        operation to associate an alias with a distribution, you provide the
        alias and the ID of the target distribution for the alias. For more
        information, including how to set up the target distribution,
        prerequisites that you must complete, and other restrictions, see <a

        in a continuous deployment workflow.</p> <p>After you create a staging
        distribution, you can use <code>UpdateDistribution</code> to modify the
        staging distribution's configuration. Then you can use

        in use in CloudFront that conflict or overlap with the provided alias.
        For example, if you provide <code>www.example.com</code> as input, the
        returned list can include <code>www.example.com</code> and the
        overlapping wildcard alternate domain name (<code>*.example.com</code>),
        if they exist. If you provide <code>*.example.com</code> as input, the

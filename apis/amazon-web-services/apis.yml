      <p>Identity and Access Management Access Analyzer helps you to set,
      verify, and refine your IAM policies by providing a suite of capabilities.
      Its features include findings for external and unused access, basic and
      custom policy checks for validating policies, and policy generation to
      generate fine-grained policies. To start using IAM Access Analyzer to
      identify external or unused access, you first need to create an
      analyzer.</p> <p> <b>External access analyzers</b> help identify potential
      risks of accessing resources by enabling you to identify any resource
      policies that grant access to an external principal. It does this by using
      logic-based reasoning to analyze resource-based policies in your Amazon
      Web Services environment. An external principal can be another Amazon Web
      Services account, a root user, an IAM user or role, a federated user, an
      Amazon Web Services service, or an anonymous user. You can also use IAM
      Access Analyzer to preview public and cross-account access to your
      resources before deploying permissions changes.</p> <p> <b>Unused access
      analyzers</b> help identify potential identity access risks by enabling
      you to identify unused IAM roles, unused access keys, unused console
      passwords, and IAM principals with unused service and action-level
      permissions.</p> <p>Beyond findings, IAM Access Analyzer provides basic
      and custom policy checks to validate IAM policies before deploying
      permissions changes. You can use policy generation to refine permissions
      by attaching a policy generated using access activity logged in CloudTrail
      logs. </p> <p>This guide describes the IAM Access Analyzer operations that
      you can call programmatically. For general information about IAM Access
      Analyzer, see <a
      href="https://docs.aws.amazon.com/IAM/latest/UserGuide/what-is-access-analyzer.html">Identity
      and Access Management Access Analyzer</a> in the <b>IAM User

      <p>This is the <i>Amazon Web Services Private Certificate Authority API
      Reference</i>. It provides descriptions, syntax, and usage examples for
      each of the actions and data types involved in creating and managing a
      private certificate authority (CA) for your organization.</p> <p>The
      documentation for each action shows the API request parameters and the
      JSON response. Alternatively, you can use one of the Amazon Web Services
      SDKs to access an API that is tailored to the programming language or
      platform that you prefer. For more information, see <a
      href="https://aws.amazon.com/tools/#SDKs">Amazon Web Services
      SDKs</a>.</p> <p>Each Amazon Web Services Private CA API operation has a
      quota that determines the number of times the operation can be called per
      second. Amazon Web Services Private CA throttles API requests at different
      rates depending on the operation. Throttling means that Amazon Web
      Services Private CA rejects an otherwise valid request because the request
      exceeds the operation's quota for the number of requests per second. When
      a request is throttled, Amazon Web Services Private CA returns a <a
      href="https://docs.aws.amazon.com/privateca/latest/APIReference/CommonErrors.html">ThrottlingException</a>
      error. Amazon Web Services Private CA does not guarantee a minimum request
      rate for APIs. </p> <p>To see an up-to-date list of your Amazon Web

      <p>Use AppConfig, a capability of Amazon Web Services Systems Manager, to
      create, manage, and quickly deploy application configurations. AppConfig
      supports controlled deployments to applications of any size and includes
      built-in validation checks and monitoring. You can use AppConfig with
      applications hosted on Amazon EC2 instances, Lambda, containers, mobile
      applications, or IoT devices.</p> <p>To prevent errors when deploying
      application configurations, especially for production systems where a
      simple typo could cause an unexpected outage, AppConfig includes
      validators. A validator provides a syntactic or semantic check to ensure
      that the configuration you want to deploy works as intended. To validate
      your application configuration data, you provide a schema or an Amazon Web
      Services Lambda function that runs against the configuration. The
      configuration deployment or update can only proceed when the configuration
      data is valid.</p> <p>During a configuration deployment, AppConfig
      monitors the application to ensure that the deployment is successful. If
      the system encounters an error, AppConfig rolls back the change to
      minimize impact for your application users. You can configure a deployment
      strategy for each application or environment that includes deployment
      criteria, including velocity, bake time, and alarms to monitor. Similar to
      error monitoring, if a deployment triggers an alarm, AppConfig
      automatically rolls back to the previous version. </p> <p>AppConfig
      supports multiple use cases. Here are some examples:</p> <ul> <li> <p>
      <b>Feature flags</b>: Use AppConfig to turn on new features that require a
      timely deployment, such as a product launch or announcement. </p> </li>
      <li> <p> <b>Application tuning</b>: Use AppConfig to carefully introduce
      changes to your application that can only be tested with production
      traffic.</p> </li> <li> <p> <b>Allow list</b>: Use AppConfig to allow
      premium subscribers to access paid content. </p> </li> <li> <p>
      <b>Operational issues</b>: Use AppConfig to reduce stress on your
      application when a dependency or other external factor impacts the
      system.</p> </li> </ul> <p>This reference is intended to be used with the

      <p>AppConfig Data provides the data plane APIs your application uses to
      retrieve configuration data. Here's how it works:</p> <p>Your application
      retrieves configuration data by first establishing a configuration session
      using the AppConfig Data <a>StartConfigurationSession</a> API action. Your
      session's client then makes periodic calls to
      <a>GetLatestConfiguration</a> to check for and retrieve the latest data
      available.</p> <p>When calling <code>StartConfigurationSession</code>,
      your code sends the following information:</p> <ul> <li> <p>Identifiers
      (ID or name) of an AppConfig application, environment, and configuration
      profile that the session tracks.</p> </li> <li> <p>(Optional) The minimum
      amount of time the session's client must wait between calls to
      <code>GetLatestConfiguration</code>.</p> </li> </ul> <p>In response,
      AppConfig provides an <code>InitialConfigurationToken</code> to be given
      to the session's client and used the first time it calls
      <code>GetLatestConfiguration</code> for that session.</p> <important>
      <p>This token should only be used once in your first call to
      <code>GetLatestConfiguration</code>. You <i>must</i> use the new token in
      the <code>GetLatestConfiguration</code> response
      (<code>NextPollConfigurationToken</code>) in each subsequent call to
      <code>GetLatestConfiguration</code>.</p> </important> <p>When calling
      <code>GetLatestConfiguration</code>, your client code sends the most
      recent <code>ConfigurationToken</code> value it has and receives in
      response:</p> <ul> <li> <p> <code>NextPollConfigurationToken</code>: the
      <code>ConfigurationToken</code> value to use on the next call to
      <code>GetLatestConfiguration</code>.</p> </li> <li> <p>
      <code>NextPollIntervalInSeconds</code>: the duration the client should
      wait before making its next call to <code>GetLatestConfiguration</code>.
      This duration may vary over the course of the session, so it should be
      used instead of the value sent on the
      <code>StartConfigurationSession</code> call.</p> </li> <li> <p>The
      configuration: the latest data intended for the session. This may be empty
      if the client already has the latest version of the configuration.</p>
      </li> </ul> <important> <p>The <code>InitialConfigurationToken</code> and
      <code>NextPollConfigurationToken</code> should only be used once. To
      support long poll use cases, the tokens are valid for up to 24 hours. If a
      <code>GetLatestConfiguration</code> call uses an expired token, the system
      returns <code>BadRequestException</code>.</p> </important> <p>For more
      information and to view example CLI commands that show how to retrieve a
      configuration using the AppConfig Data

      Application Auto Scaling service API includes three key sets of actions:
      </p> <ul> <li> <p>Register and manage scalable targets - Register Amazon
      Web Services or custom resources as scalable targets (a resource that
      Application Auto Scaling can scale), set minimum and maximum capacity
      limits, and retrieve information on existing scalable targets.</p> </li>
      <li> <p>Configure and manage automatic scaling - Define scaling policies
      to dynamically scale your resources in response to CloudWatch alarms,
      schedule one-time or recurring scaling actions, and retrieve your recent
      scaling activity history.</p> </li> <li> <p>Suspend and resume scaling -
      Temporarily suspend and later resume automatic scaling by calling the <a
      href="https://docs.aws.amazon.com/autoscaling/application/APIReference/API_RegisterScalableTarget.html">RegisterScalableTarget</a>
      API action for any Application Auto Scaling scalable target. You can
      suspend and resume (individually or in combination) scale-out activities
      that are triggered by a scaling policy, scale-in activities that are
      triggered by a scaling policy, and scheduled scaling.</p> </li> </ul>

      Application Insights identifies, recommends, and sets up metrics and logs.
      It continuously analyzes and correlates your metrics and logs for unusual
      behavior to surface actionable problems with your application. For
      example, if your application is slow and unresponsive and leading to HTTP
      500 errors in your Application Load Balancer (ALB), Application Insights
      informs you that a memory pressure problem with your SQL Server database
      is occurring. It bases this analysis on impactful metrics and log errors.

      <p>Welcome to the Zonal Shift API Reference Guide for Amazon Route 53
      Application Recovery Controller (Route 53 ARC).</p> <p>You can start a
      zonal shift to move traffic for a load balancer resource away from an
      Availability Zone to help your application recover quickly from an
      impairment in an Availability Zone. For example, you can recover your
      application from a developer's bad code deployment or from an Amazon Web
      Services infrastructure failure in a single Availability Zone.</p> <p>You
      can also configure zonal autoshift for a load balancer resource. Zonal
      autoshift is a capability in Route 53 ARC where Amazon Web Services shifts
      away application resource traffic from an Availability Zone, on your
      behalf, to help reduce your time to recovery during events. Amazon Web
      Services shifts away traffic for resources that are enabled for zonal
      autoshift whenever Amazon Web Services determines that there's an issue in
      the Availability Zone that could potentially affect customers.</p> <p>To
      ensure that zonal autoshift is safe for your application, you must also
      configure practice runs when you enable zonal autoshift for a resource.
      Practice runs start weekly zonal shifts for a resource, to shift traffic
      for the resource out of an Availability Zone. Practice runs make sure, on
      a regular basis, that you have enough capacity in all the Availability
      Zones in an Amazon Web Services Region for your application to continue to
      operate normally when traffic for a resource is shifted away from one
      Availability Zone.</p> <important> <p>You must prescale resource capacity
      in all Availability Zones in the Region where your application is
      deployed, before you configure practice runs or enable zonal autoshift for
      a resource. You should not rely on scaling on demand when an autoshift or
      practice run starts. </p> </important> <p>For more information about using
      zonal shift and zonal autoshift, see the <a

      <fullname>Batch</fullname> <p>Using Batch, you can run batch computing
      workloads on the Amazon Web Services Cloud. Batch computing is a common
      means for developers, scientists, and engineers to access large amounts of
      compute resources. Batch uses the advantages of the batch computing to
      remove the undifferentiated heavy lifting of configuring and managing
      required infrastructure. At the same time, it also adopts a familiar batch
      computing software approach. You can use Batch to efficiently provision
      resources d, and work toward eliminating capacity constraints, reducing
      your overall compute costs, and delivering results more quickly.</p> <p>As
      a fully managed service, Batch can run batch computing workloads of any
      scale. Batch automatically provisions compute resources and optimizes
      workload distribution based on the quantity and scale of your specific
      workloads. With Batch, there's no need to install or manage batch
      computing software. This means that you can focus on analyzing results and
      solving your specific problems instead.</p>

      <p> CodeArtifact is a fully managed artifact repository compatible with
      language-native package managers and build tools such as npm, Apache
      Maven, pip, and dotnet. You can use CodeArtifact to share packages with
      development teams and pull packages. Packages can be pulled from both
      public and CodeArtifact repositories. You can also create an upstream
      relationship between a CodeArtifact repository and another repository,
      which effectively merges their contents from the point of view of a
      package manager client. </p> <p> <b>CodeArtifact Components</b> </p>
      <p>Use the information in this guide to help you work with the following
      CodeArtifact components:</p> <ul> <li> <p> <b>Repository</b>: A
      CodeArtifact repository contains a set of <a
      href="https://docs.aws.amazon.com/codeartifact/latest/ug/welcome.html#welcome-concepts-package-version">package
      versions</a>, each of which maps to a set of assets, or files.
      Repositories are polyglot, so a single repository can contain packages of
      any supported type. Each repository exposes endpoints for fetching and
      publishing packages using tools like the <b> <code>npm</code> </b> CLI,
      the Maven CLI (<b> <code>mvn</code> </b>), Python CLIs (<b>
      <code>pip</code> </b> and <code>twine</code>), and NuGet CLIs
      (<code>nuget</code> and <code>dotnet</code>).</p> </li> <li> <p>
      <b>Domain</b>: Repositories are aggregated into a higher-level entity
      known as a <i>domain</i>. All package assets and metadata are stored in
      the domain, but are consumed through repositories. A given package asset,
      such as a Maven JAR file, is stored once per domain, no matter how many
      repositories it's present in. All of the assets and metadata in a domain
      are encrypted with the same customer master key (CMK) stored in Key
      Management Service (KMS).</p> <p>Each repository is a member of a single
      domain and can't be moved to a different domain.</p> <p>The domain allows
      organizational policy to be applied across multiple repositories, such as
      which accounts can access repositories in the domain, and which public
      repositories can be used as sources of packages.</p> <p>Although an
      organization can have multiple domains, we recommend a single production
      domain that contains all published artifacts so that teams can find and
      share packages across their organization.</p> </li> <li> <p>
      <b>Package</b>: A <i>package</i> is a bundle of software and the metadata
      required to resolve dependencies and install the software. CodeArtifact
      supports <a
      href="https://docs.aws.amazon.com/codeartifact/latest/ug/using-npm.html">npm</a>,
      <a
      href="https://docs.aws.amazon.com/codeartifact/latest/ug/using-python.html">PyPI</a>,
      <a
      href="https://docs.aws.amazon.com/codeartifact/latest/ug/using-maven">Maven</a>,
      and <a
      href="https://docs.aws.amazon.com/codeartifact/latest/ug/using-nuget">NuGet</a>
      package formats.</p> <p>In CodeArtifact, a package consists of:</p> <ul>
      <li> <p>A <i>name</i> (for example, <code>webpack</code> is the name of a
      popular npm package)</p> </li> <li> <p>An optional namespace (for example,
      <code>@types</code> in <code>@types/node</code>)</p> </li> <li> <p>A set
      of versions (for example, <code>1.0.0</code>, <code>1.0.1</code>,
      <code>1.0.2</code>, etc.)</p> </li> <li> <p> Package-level metadata (for
      example, npm tags)</p> </li> </ul> </li> <li> <p> <b>Package version</b>:
      A version of a package, such as <code>@types/node 12.6.9</code>. The
      version number format and semantics vary for different package formats.
      For example, npm package versions must conform to the <a
      href="https://semver.org/">Semantic Versioning specification</a>. In
      CodeArtifact, a package version consists of the version identifier,
      metadata at the package version level, and a set of assets.</p> </li> <li>
      <p> <b>Upstream repository</b>: One repository is <i>upstream</i> of
      another when the package versions in it can be accessed from the
      repository endpoint of the downstream repository, effectively merging the
      contents of the two repositories from the point of view of a client.
      CodeArtifact allows creating an upstream relationship between two
      repositories.</p> </li> <li> <p> <b>Asset</b>: An individual file stored
      in CodeArtifact associated with a package version, such as an npm
      <code>.tgz</code> file or Maven POM and JAR files.</p> </li> </ul>
      <p>CodeArtifact supports these operations:</p> <ul> <li> <p>
      <code>AssociateExternalConnection</code>: Adds an existing external
      connection to a repository. </p> </li> <li> <p>
      <code>CopyPackageVersions</code>: Copies package versions from one
      repository to another repository in the same domain.</p> </li> <li> <p>
      <code>CreateDomain</code>: Creates a domain</p> </li> <li> <p>
      <code>CreateRepository</code>: Creates a CodeArtifact repository in a
      domain. </p> </li> <li> <p> <code>DeleteDomain</code>: Deletes a domain.
      You cannot delete a domain that contains repositories. </p> </li> <li> <p>

      <p>Use the information in this guide to help you work with the following
      CodeDeploy components:</p> <ul> <li> <p> <b>Application</b>: A name that
      uniquely identifies the application you want to deploy. CodeDeploy uses
      this name, which functions as a container, to ensure the correct
      combination of revision, deployment configuration, and deployment group
      are referenced during a deployment.</p> </li> <li> <p> <b>Deployment
      group</b>: A set of individual instances, CodeDeploy Lambda deployment
      configuration settings, or an Amazon ECS service and network details. A
      Lambda deployment group specifies how to route traffic to a new version of
      a Lambda function. An Amazon ECS deployment group specifies the service
      created in Amazon ECS to deploy, a load balancer, and a listener to
      reroute production traffic to an updated containerized application. An
      Amazon EC2/On-premises deployment group contains individually tagged
      instances, Amazon EC2 instances in Amazon EC2 Auto Scaling groups, or
      both. All deployment groups can specify optional trigger, alarm, and
      rollback settings.</p> </li> <li> <p> <b>Deployment configuration</b>: A
      set of deployment rules and deployment success and failure conditions used
      by CodeDeploy during a deployment.</p> </li> <li> <p> <b>Deployment</b>:
      The process and the components used when updating a Lambda function, a
      containerized application in an Amazon ECS service, or of installing
      content on one or more instances. </p> </li> <li> <p> <b>Application
      revisions</b>: For an Lambda deployment, this is an AppSpec file that
      specifies the Lambda function to be updated and one or more functions to
      validate deployment lifecycle events. For an Amazon ECS deployment, this
      is an AppSpec file that specifies the Amazon ECS task definition,
      container, and port where production traffic is rerouted. For an
      EC2/On-premises deployment, this is an archive file that contains source
      content—source code, webpages, executable files, and deployment
      scripts—along with an AppSpec file. Revisions are stored in Amazon S3
      buckets or GitHub repositories. For Amazon S3, a revision is uniquely
      identified by its Amazon S3 object key and its ETag, version, or both. For
      GitHub, a revision is uniquely identified by its commit ID.</p> </li>
      </ul> <p>This guide also contains information to help you get details
      about the instances in your deployments, to make on-premises instances
      available for CodeDeploy deployments, to get details about a Lambda
      function deployment, and to get details about Amazon ECS service
      deployments.</p> <p> <b>CodeDeploy Information Resources</b> </p> <ul>

      <fullname>CodePipeline</fullname> <p> <b>Overview</b> </p> <p>This is the
      CodePipeline API Reference. This guide provides descriptions of the
      actions and data types for CodePipeline. Some functionality for your
      pipeline can only be configured through the API. For more information, see
      the <a
      href="https://docs.aws.amazon.com/codepipeline/latest/userguide/welcome.html">CodePipeline
      User Guide</a>.</p> <p>You can use the CodePipeline API to work with
      pipelines, stages, actions, and transitions.</p> <p> <i>Pipelines</i> are
      models of automated release processes. Each pipeline is uniquely named,
      and consists of stages, actions, and transitions. </p> <p>You can work
      with pipelines by calling:</p> <ul> <li> <p> <a>CreatePipeline</a>, which
      creates a uniquely named pipeline.</p> </li> <li> <p>
      <a>DeletePipeline</a>, which deletes the specified pipeline.</p> </li>
      <li> <p> <a>GetPipeline</a>, which returns information about the pipeline
      structure and pipeline metadata, including the pipeline Amazon Resource
      Name (ARN).</p> </li> <li> <p> <a>GetPipelineExecution</a>, which returns
      information about a specific execution of a pipeline.</p> </li> <li> <p>
      <a>GetPipelineState</a>, which returns information about the current state
      of the stages and actions of a pipeline.</p> </li> <li> <p>
      <a>ListActionExecutions</a>, which returns action-level details for past
      executions. The details include full stage and action-level details,
      including individual action duration, status, any errors that occurred
      during the execution, and input and output artifact location details.</p>
      </li> <li> <p> <a>ListPipelines</a>, which gets a summary of all of the
      pipelines associated with your account.</p> </li> <li> <p>
      <a>ListPipelineExecutions</a>, which gets a summary of the most recent
      executions for a pipeline.</p> </li> <li> <p>
      <a>StartPipelineExecution</a>, which runs the most recent revision of an
      artifact through the pipeline.</p> </li> <li> <p>
      <a>StopPipelineExecution</a>, which stops the specified pipeline execution
      from continuing through the pipeline.</p> </li> <li> <p>
      <a>UpdatePipeline</a>, which updates a pipeline with edits or changes to
      the structure of the pipeline.</p> </li> </ul> <p>Pipelines include
      <i>stages</i>. Each stage contains one or more actions that must complete
      before the next stage begins. A stage results in success or failure. If a
      stage fails, the pipeline stops at that stage and remains stopped until
      either a new version of an artifact appears in the source location, or a
      user takes action to rerun the most recent artifact through the pipeline.
      You can call <a>GetPipelineState</a>, which displays the status of a
      pipeline, including the status of stages in the pipeline, or
      <a>GetPipeline</a>, which returns the entire structure of the pipeline,
      including the stages of that pipeline. For more information about the
      structure of stages and actions, see <a
      href="https://docs.aws.amazon.com/codepipeline/latest/userguide/pipeline-structure.html">CodePipeline
      Pipeline Structure Reference</a>.</p> <p>Pipeline stages include
      <i>actions</i> that are categorized into categories such as source or
      build actions performed in a stage of a pipeline. For example, you can use
      a source action to import artifacts into a pipeline from a source such as
      Amazon S3. Like stages, you do not work with actions directly in most
      cases, but you do define and interact with actions when working with
      pipeline operations such as <a>CreatePipeline</a> and
      <a>GetPipelineState</a>. Valid action categories are:</p> <ul> <li>
      <p>Source</p> </li> <li> <p>Build</p> </li> <li> <p>Test</p> </li> <li>
      <p>Deploy</p> </li> <li> <p>Approval</p> </li> <li> <p>Invoke</p> </li>
      </ul> <p>Pipelines also include <i>transitions</i>, which allow the
      transition of artifacts from one stage to the next in a pipeline after the
      actions in one stage complete.</p> <p>You can work with transitions by
      calling:</p> <ul> <li> <p> <a>DisableStageTransition</a>, which prevents
      artifacts from transitioning to the next stage in a pipeline.</p> </li>
      <li> <p> <a>EnableStageTransition</a>, which enables transition of
      artifacts between stages in a pipeline. </p> </li> </ul> <p> <b>Using the
      API to integrate with CodePipeline</b> </p> <p>For third-party integrators
      or developers who want to create their own integrations with CodePipeline,
      the expected sequence varies from the standard API user. To integrate with
      CodePipeline, developers need to work with the following items:</p> <p>
      <b>Jobs</b>, which are instances of an action. For example, a job for a
      source action might import a revision of an artifact from a source. </p>
      <p>You can work with jobs by calling:</p> <ul> <li> <p>
      <a>AcknowledgeJob</a>, which confirms whether a job worker has received
      the specified job.</p> </li> <li> <p> <a>GetJobDetails</a>, which returns
      the details of a job.</p> </li> <li> <p> <a>PollForJobs</a>, which
      determines whether there are any jobs to act on.</p> </li> <li> <p>
      <a>PutJobFailureResult</a>, which provides details of a job failure. </p>
      </li> <li> <p> <a>PutJobSuccessResult</a>, which provides details of a job
      success.</p> </li> </ul> <p> <b>Third party jobs</b>, which are instances
      of an action created by a partner action and integrated into CodePipeline.
      Partner actions are created by members of the Amazon Web Services Partner
      Network.</p> <p>You can work with third party jobs by calling:</p> <ul>
      <li> <p> <a>AcknowledgeThirdPartyJob</a>, which confirms whether a job
      worker has received the specified job.</p> </li> <li> <p>
      <a>GetThirdPartyJobDetails</a>, which requests the details of a job for a
      partner action.</p> </li> <li> <p> <a>PollForThirdPartyJobs</a>, which
      determines whether there are any jobs to act on. </p> </li> <li> <p>
      <a>PutThirdPartyJobFailureResult</a>, which provides details of a job
      failure.</p> </li> <li> <p> <a>PutThirdPartyJobSuccessResult</a>, which
      provides details of a job success.</p> </li> </ul>

      <fullname>Amazon Cognito Sync</fullname> <p>Amazon Cognito Sync provides
      an AWS service and client library that enable cross-device syncing of
      application-related user data. High-level client libraries are available
      for both iOS and Android. You can use these libraries to persist data
      locally so that it's available even if the device is offline. Developer
      credentials don't need to be stored on the mobile device to access the
      service. You can use Amazon Cognito to obtain a normalized user ID and
      credentials. User data is persisted in a dataset that can store up to 1 MB
      of key-value pairs, and you can have up to 20 datasets per user
      identity.</p> <p>With Amazon Cognito Sync, the data stored for each
      identity is accessible only to credentials assigned to that identity. In
      order to use the Cognito Sync service, you need to make API calls using
      credentials retrieved with <a
      href="http://docs.aws.amazon.com/cognitoidentity/latest/APIReference/Welcome.html">Amazon
      Cognito Identity service</a>.</p> <p>If you want to use Cognito Sync in an
      Android or iOS application, you will probably want to make API calls via
      the AWS Mobile SDK. To learn more, see the <a

      <fullname>AWS CodeStar Connections</fullname> <p>This Amazon Web Services
      CodeStar Connections API Reference provides descriptions and usage
      examples of the operations and data types for the Amazon Web Services
      CodeStar Connections API. You can use the connections API to work with
      connections and installations.</p> <p> <i>Connections</i> are
      configurations that you use to connect Amazon Web Services resources to
      external code repositories. Each connection is a resource that can be
      given to services such as CodePipeline to connect to a third-party
      repository such as Bitbucket. For example, you can add the connection in
      CodePipeline so that it triggers your pipeline when a code change is made
      to your third-party code repository. Each connection is named and
      associated with a unique ARN that is used to reference the connection.</p>
      <p>When you create a connection, the console initiates a third-party
      connection handshake. <i>Installations</i> are the apps that are used to
      conduct this handshake. For example, the installation for the Bitbucket
      provider type is the Bitbucket app. When you create a connection, you can
      choose an existing installation or create one.</p> <p>When you want to
      create a connection to an installed provider type such as GitHub
      Enterprise Server, you create a <i>host</i> for your connections.</p>
      <p>You can work with connections by calling:</p> <ul> <li> <p>
      <a>CreateConnection</a>, which creates a uniquely named connection that
      can be referenced by services such as CodePipeline.</p> </li> <li> <p>
      <a>DeleteConnection</a>, which deletes the specified connection.</p> </li>
      <li> <p> <a>GetConnection</a>, which returns information about the
      connection, including the connection status.</p> </li> <li> <p>
      <a>ListConnections</a>, which lists the connections associated with your

      uniquely identifies a device and supplies the user with a consistent
      identity over the lifetime of an application.</p> <p>Using Amazon Cognito
      Federated Identities, you can enable authentication with one or more
      third-party identity providers (Facebook, Google, or Login with Amazon) or
      an Amazon Cognito user pool, and you can also choose to support
      unauthenticated access from your app. Cognito delivers a unique identifier
      for each user and acts as an OpenID token provider trusted by AWS Security
      Token Service (STS) to access temporary, limited-privilege AWS
      credentials.</p> <p>For a description of the authentication flow from the

      <p>AWS Data Pipeline configures and manages a data-driven workflow called
      a pipeline. AWS Data Pipeline handles the details of scheduling and
      ensuring that data dependencies are met so that your application can focus
      on processing the data.</p> <p>AWS Data Pipeline provides a JAR
      implementation of a task runner called AWS Data Pipeline Task Runner. AWS
      Data Pipeline Task Runner provides logic for common data management
      scenarios, such as performing database queries and running data analysis
      using Amazon Elastic MapReduce (Amazon EMR). You can use AWS Data Pipeline
      Task Runner as your task runner, or you can write your own task runner to
      provide custom data management.</p> <p>AWS Data Pipeline implements two
      main sets of functionality. Use the first set to create a pipeline and
      define data sources, schedules, dependencies, and the transforms to be
      performed on the data. Use the second set in your task runner application
      to receive the next task ready for processing. The logic for performing
      the task, such as querying the data, running data analysis, or converting
      the data from one format to another, is contained within the task runner.
      The task runner performs the task assigned to it by the web service,
      reporting progress to the web service as it does so. When the task is
      done, the task runner reports the final success or failure of the task to
      the web service.</p>

      or updated over time. Data sets can be updated using revisions, which
      represent a new version or incremental change to a data set. A revision
      contains one or more assets. An asset in AWS Data Exchange is a piece of
      data that can be stored as an Amazon S3 object, Redshift datashare, API
      Gateway API, AWS Lake Formation data permission, or Amazon S3 data access.
      The asset can be a structured data file, an image file, or some other data

    description: >-
      <p>Detective uses machine learning and purpose-built visualizations to
      help you to analyze and investigate security issues across your Amazon Web
      Services (Amazon Web Services) workloads. Detective automatically extracts
      time-based events such as login attempts, API calls, and network traffic
      from CloudTrail and Amazon Virtual Private Cloud (Amazon VPC) flow logs.
      It also extracts findings detected by Amazon GuardDuty.</p> <p>The
      Detective API primarily supports the creation and management of behavior
      graphs. A behavior graph contains the extracted data from a set of member
      accounts, and is created and managed by an administrator account.</p>
      <p>To add a member account to the behavior graph, the administrator
      account sends an invitation to the account. When the account accepts the
      invitation, it becomes a member account in the behavior graph.</p>
      <p>Detective is also integrated with Organizations. The organization
      management account designates the Detective administrator account for the
      organization. That account becomes the administrator account for the
      organization behavior graph. The Detective administrator account is also
      the delegated administrator account for Detective in Organizations.</p>
      <p>The Detective administrator account can enable any organization account
      as a member account in the organization behavior graph. The organization
      accounts do not receive invitations. The Detective administrator account
      can also invite other accounts to the organization behavior graph.</p>
      <p>Every behavior graph is specific to a Region. You can only use the API
      to manage behavior graphs that belong to the Region that is associated
      with the currently selected endpoint.</p> <p>The administrator account for
      a behavior graph can use the Detective API to do the following:</p> <ul>
      <li> <p>Enable and disable Detective. Enabling Detective creates a new
      behavior graph.</p> </li> <li> <p>View the list of member accounts in a
      behavior graph.</p> </li> <li> <p>Add member accounts to a behavior
      graph.</p> </li> <li> <p>Remove member accounts from a behavior graph.</p>
      </li> <li> <p>Apply tags to a behavior graph.</p> </li> </ul> <p>The
      organization management account can use the Detective API to select the
      delegated administrator for Detective.</p> <p>The Detective administrator
      account for an organization can use the Detective API to do the
      following:</p> <ul> <li> <p>Perform all of the functions of an
      administrator account.</p> </li> <li> <p>Determine whether to
      automatically enable new organization accounts as member accounts in the
      organization behavior graph.</p> </li> </ul> <p>An invited member account
      can use the Detective API to do the following:</p> <ul> <li> <p>View the
      list of behavior graphs that they are invited to.</p> </li> <li> <p>Accept
      an invitation to contribute to a behavior graph.</p> </li> <li> <p>Decline
      an invitation to contribute to a behavior graph.</p> </li> <li> <p>Remove
      their account from a behavior graph.</p> </li> </ul> <p>All API actions
      are logged as CloudTrail events. See <a
      href="https://docs.aws.amazon.com/detective/latest/adminguide/logging-using-cloudtrail.html">Logging
      Detective API Calls with CloudTrail</a>.</p> <note> <p>We replaced the
      term "master account" with the term "administrator account." An
      administrator account is used to centrally manage multiple accounts. In
      the case of Detective, the administrator account manages the accounts in
      their behavior graph.</p> </note>

      <fullname>Amazon Web Services Application Discovery Service</fullname>
      <p>Amazon Web Services Application Discovery Service (Application
      Discovery Service) helps you plan application migration projects. It
      automatically identifies servers, virtual machines (VMs), and network
      dependencies in your on-premises data centers. For more information, see
      the <a href="http://aws.amazon.com/application-discovery/faqs/">Amazon Web
      Services Application Discovery Service FAQ</a>. </p> <p>Application
      Discovery Service offers three ways of performing discovery and collecting
      data about your on-premises servers:</p> <ul> <li> <p> <b>Agentless
      discovery</b> using Amazon Web Services Application Discovery Service
      Agentless Collector (Agentless Collector), which doesn't require you to
      install an agent on each host.</p> <ul> <li> <p>Agentless Collector
      gathers server information regardless of the operating systems, which
      minimizes the time required for initial on-premises infrastructure
      assessment.</p> </li> <li> <p>Agentless Collector doesn't collect
      information about network dependencies, only agent-based discovery
      collects that information. </p> </li> </ul> </li> </ul> <ul> <li> <p>
      <b>Agent-based discovery</b> using the Amazon Web Services Application
      Discovery Agent (Application Discovery Agent) collects a richer set of
      data than agentless discovery, which you install on one or more hosts in
      your data center.</p> <ul> <li> <p> The agent captures infrastructure and
      application information, including an inventory of running processes,
      system performance information, resource utilization, and network
      dependencies.</p> </li> <li> <p>The information collected by agents is
      secured at rest and in transit to the Application Discovery Service
      database in the Amazon Web Services cloud. For more information, see <a
      href="https://docs.aws.amazon.com/application-discovery/latest/userguide/discovery-agent.html">Amazon
      Web Services Application Discovery Agent</a>.</p> </li> </ul> </li> </ul>
      <ul> <li> <p> <b>Amazon Web Services Partner Network (APN) solutions</b>
      integrate with Application Discovery Service, enabling you to import
      details of your on-premises environment directly into Amazon Web Services
      Migration Hub (Migration Hub) without using Agentless Collector or
      Application Discovery Agent.</p> <ul> <li> <p>Third-party application
      discovery tools can query Amazon Web Services Application Discovery
      Service, and they can write to the Application Discovery Service database
      using the public API.</p> </li> <li> <p>In this way, you can import data
      into Migration Hub and view it, so that you can associate applications
      with servers and track migrations.</p> </li> </ul> </li> </ul> <p>
      <b>Working With This Guide</b> </p> <p>This API reference provides
      descriptions, syntax, and usage examples for each of the actions and data
      types for Application Discovery Service. The topic for each action shows
      the API request parameters and the response. Alternatively, you can use
      one of the Amazon Web Services SDKs to access an API that is tailored to
      the programming language or platform that you're using. For more
      information, see <a href="http://aws.amazon.com/tools/#SDKs">Amazon Web
      Services SDKs</a>.</p> <note> <ul> <li> <p>Remember that you must set your
      Migration Hub home Region before you call any of these APIs.</p> </li>
      <li> <p>You must make API calls for write actions (create, notify,
      associate, disassociate, import, or put) while in your home Region, or a
      <code>HomeRegionNotSetException</code> error is returned.</p> </li> <li>
      <p>API calls for read actions (list, describe, stop, and delete) are
      permitted outside of your home Region.</p> </li> <li> <p>Although it is
      unlikely, the Migration Hub home Region could change. If you call APIs
      outside the home Region, an <code>InvalidInputException</code> is
      returned.</p> </li> <li> <p>You must call <code>GetHomeRegion</code> to
      obtain the latest Migration Hub home Region.</p> </li> </ul> </note>

      backup services for Amazon EBS, the EBS direct APIs make it more efficient
      and cost-effective to track incremental changes on your Amazon EBS volumes
      through snapshots. This can be done without having to create new volumes
      from snapshots, and then use Amazon Elastic Compute Cloud (Amazon EC2)
      instances to compare the differences.</p> <p>You can create incremental
      snapshots directly from data on-premises into volumes and the cloud to use
      for quick disaster recovery. With the ability to write and read snapshots,
      you can write your on-premises data to an snapshot during a disaster. Then
      after recovery, you can restore it back to Amazon Web Services or
      on-premises from the snapshot. You no longer need to build and maintain
      complex mechanisms to copy data to and from Amazon EBS.</p> <p>This API
      reference provides detailed information about the actions, data types,
      parameters, and errors of the EBS direct APIs. For more information about
      the elements that make up the EBS direct APIs, and examples of how to use

      access to many familiar Amazon EC2 features.</p> <p>You can use Amazon ECS
      to schedule the placement of containers across your cluster based on your
      resource needs, isolation policies, and availability requirements. With
      Amazon ECS, you don't need to operate your own cluster management and
      configuration management systems. You also don't need to worry about

      <fullname>Global Accelerator</fullname> <p>This is the <i>Global
      Accelerator API Reference</i>. This guide is for developers who need
      detailed information about Global Accelerator API actions, data types, and
      errors. For more information about Global Accelerator features, see the <a
      href="https://docs.aws.amazon.com/global-accelerator/latest/dg/what-is-global-accelerator.html">Global
      Accelerator Developer Guide</a>.</p> <p>Global Accelerator is a service in
      which you create <i>accelerators</i> to improve the performance of your
      applications for local and global users. Depending on the type of
      accelerator you choose, you can gain additional benefits. </p> <ul> <li>
      <p>By using a standard accelerator, you can improve availability of your
      internet applications that are used by a global audience. With a standard
      accelerator, Global Accelerator directs traffic to optimal endpoints over
      the Amazon Web Services global network. </p> </li> <li> <p>For other
      scenarios, you might choose a custom routing accelerator. With a custom
      routing accelerator, you can use application logic to directly map one or
      more users to a specific endpoint among many endpoints.</p> </li> </ul>
      <important> <p>Global Accelerator is a global service that supports
      endpoints in multiple Amazon Web Services Regions but you must specify the
      US West (Oregon) Region to create, update, or otherwise work with
      accelerators. That is, for example, specify <code>--region
      us-west-2</code> on Amazon Web Services CLI commands.</p> </important>
      <p>By default, Global Accelerator provides you with static IP addresses
      that you associate with your accelerator. The static IP addresses are
      anycast from the Amazon Web Services edge network. For IPv4, Global
      Accelerator provides two static IPv4 addresses. For dual-stack, Global
      Accelerator provides a total of four addresses: two static IPv4 addresses
      and two static IPv6 addresses. With a standard accelerator for IPv4,
      instead of using the addresses that Global Accelerator provides, you can
      configure these entry points to be IPv4 addresses from your own IP address
      ranges that you bring to Global Accelerator (BYOIP). </p> <p>For a
      standard accelerator, they distribute incoming application traffic across
      multiple endpoint resources in multiple Amazon Web Services Regions ,
      which increases the availability of your applications. Endpoints for
      standard accelerators can be Network Load Balancers, Application Load
      Balancers, Amazon EC2 instances, or Elastic IP addresses that are located
      in one Amazon Web Services Region or multiple Amazon Web Services Regions.
      For custom routing accelerators, you map traffic that arrives to the
      static IP addresses to specific Amazon EC2 servers in endpoints that are
      virtual private cloud (VPC) subnets.</p> <important> <p>The static IP
      addresses remain assigned to your accelerator for as long as it exists,
      even if you disable the accelerator and it no longer accepts or routes
      traffic. However, when you <i>delete</i> an accelerator, you lose the
      static IP addresses that are assigned to it, so you can no longer route
      traffic by using them. You can use IAM policies like tag-based permissions
      with Global Accelerator to limit the users who have permissions to delete
      an accelerator. For more information, see <a
      href="https://docs.aws.amazon.com/global-accelerator/latest/dg/access-control-manage-access-tag-policies.html">Tag-based
      policies</a>.</p> </important> <p>For standard accelerators, Global
      Accelerator uses the Amazon Web Services global network to route traffic
      to the optimal regional endpoint based on health, client location, and
      policies that you configure. The service reacts instantly to changes in
      health or configuration to ensure that internet traffic from clients is
      always directed to healthy endpoints.</p> <p>For more information about
      understanding and using Global Accelerator, see the <a
      href="https://docs.aws.amazon.com/global-accelerator/latest/dg/what-is-global-accelerator.html">Global
      Accelerator Developer Guide</a>.</p>

      description of the remote operations to be performed, and you specify a
      list of targets that should perform the operations. The targets can be
      individual things, thing groups or both.</p> <p> AWS IoT Jobs sends a
      message to inform the targets that a job is available. The target starts
      the execution of the job by downloading the job document, performing the
      operations it specifies, and reporting its progress to AWS IoT. The Jobs
      service provides commands to track the progress of a job on a specific
      target and for all the targets of the job</p>

      <p>IoT Analytics allows you to collect large amounts of device data,
      process messages, and store them. You can then query the data and run
      sophisticated analytics on it. IoT Analytics enables advanced data
      exploration through integration with Jupyter Notebooks and data
      visualization through integration with Amazon QuickSight.</p>
      <p>Traditional analytics and business intelligence tools are designed to
      process structured data. IoT data often comes from devices that record
      noisy processes (such as temperature, motion, or sound). As a result the
      data from these devices can have significant gaps, corrupted messages, and
      false readings that must be cleaned up before analysis can occur. Also,
      IoT data is often only meaningful in the context of other data from
      external sources. </p> <p>IoT Analytics automates the steps required to
      analyze data from IoT devices. IoT Analytics filters, transforms, and
      enriches IoT data before storing it in a time-series data store for
      analysis. You can set up the service to collect only the data you need
      from your devices, apply mathematical transforms to process the data, and
      enrich the data with device-specific metadata such as device type and
      location before storing it. Then, you can analyze your data by running
      queries using the built-in SQL query engine, or perform more complex
      analytics and machine learning inference. IoT Analytics includes pre-built
      models for common IoT use cases so you can answer questions like which
      devices are about to fail or which customers are at risk of abandoning
      their wearable devices.</p>

      <p>Amazon CloudWatch Internet Monitor provides visibility into how
      internet issues impact the performance and availability between your
      applications hosted on Amazon Web Services and your end users. It can
      reduce the time it takes for you to diagnose internet issues from days to
      minutes. Internet Monitor uses the connectivity data that Amazon Web
      Services captures from its global networking footprint to calculate a
      baseline of performance and availability for internet traffic. This is the
      same data that Amazon Web Services uses to monitor internet uptime and
      availability. With those measurements as a baseline, Internet Monitor
      raises awareness for you when there are significant problems for your end
      users in the different geographic locations where your application
      runs.</p> <p>Internet Monitor publishes internet measurements to
      CloudWatch Logs and CloudWatch Metrics, to easily support using CloudWatch
      tools with health information for geographies and networks specific to
      your application. Internet Monitor sends health events to Amazon
      EventBridge so that you can set up notifications. If an issue is caused by
      the Amazon Web Services network, you also automatically receive an Amazon
      Web Services Health Dashboard notification with the steps that Amazon Web
      Services is taking to mitigate the problem.</p> <p>To use Internet
      Monitor, you create a <i>monitor</i> and associate your application's
      resources with it - VPCs, NLBs, CloudFront distributions, or WorkSpaces
      directories - so Internet Monitor can determine where your application's
      internet traffic is. Internet Monitor then provides internet measurements
      from Amazon Web Services that are specific to the locations and ASNs
      (typically, internet service providers or ISPs) that communicate with your
      application.</p> <p>For more information, see <a

      <p> <b>Introduction</b> </p> <p>The Amazon Interactive Video Service (IVS)
      API is REST compatible, using a standard HTTP API and an Amazon Web
      Services EventBridge event stream for responses. JSON is used for both
      requests and responses, including errors.</p> <p>The API is an Amazon Web
      Services regional service. For a list of supported regions and Amazon IVS
      HTTPS service endpoints, see the <a
      href="https://docs.aws.amazon.com/general/latest/gr/ivs.html">Amazon IVS
      page</a> in the <i>Amazon Web Services General Reference</i>.</p> <p> <i>
      <b>All API request parameters and URLs are case sensitive. </b> </i> </p>
      <p>For a summary of notable documentation changes in each release, see <a
      href="https://docs.aws.amazon.com/ivs/latest/userguide/doc-history.html">
      Document History</a>.</p> <p> <b>Allowed Header Values</b> </p> <ul> <li>
      <p> <code> <b>Accept:</b> </code> application/json</p> </li> <li> <p>
      <code> <b>Accept-Encoding:</b> </code> gzip, deflate</p> </li> <li> <p>
      <code> <b>Content-Type:</b> </code>application/json</p> </li> </ul> <p>
      <b>Resources</b> </p> <p>The following resources contain information about
      your IVS live stream (see <a
      href="https://docs.aws.amazon.com/ivs/latest/userguide/getting-started.html">
      Getting Started with Amazon IVS</a>):</p> <ul> <li> <p> <b>Channel</b> —
      Stores configuration data related to your live stream. You first create a
      channel and then use the channel’s stream key to start your live stream.
      See the Channel endpoints for more information. </p> </li> <li> <p>
      <b>Stream key</b> — An identifier assigned by Amazon IVS when you create a
      channel, which is then used to authorize streaming. See the StreamKey
      endpoints for more information. <i> <b>Treat the stream key like a secret,
      since it allows anyone to stream to the channel.</b> </i> </p> </li> <li>
      <p> <b>Playback key pair</b> — Video playback may be restricted using
      playback-authorization tokens, which use public-key encryption. A playback
      key pair is the public-private pair of keys used to sign and validate the
      playback-authorization token. See the PlaybackKeyPair endpoints for more
      information.</p> </li> <li> <p> <b>Recording configuration</b> — Stores
      configuration related to recording a live stream and where to store the
      recorded content. Multiple channels can reference the same recording
      configuration. See the Recording Configuration endpoints for more
      information.</p> </li> <li> <p> <b>Playback restriction policy</b> —
      Restricts playback by countries and/or origin sites. See the Playback
      Restriction Policy endpoints for more information.</p> </li> </ul> <p>
      <b>Tagging</b> </p> <p>A <i>tag</i> is a metadata label that you assign to
      an Amazon Web Services resource. A tag comprises a <i>key</i> and a
      <i>value</i>, both set by you. For example, you might set a tag as
      <code>topic:nature</code> to label a particular video category. See <a
      href="https://docs.aws.amazon.com/general/latest/gr/aws_tagging.html">Tagging
      Amazon Web Services Resources</a> for more information, including
      restrictions that apply to tags and "Tag naming limits and requirements";
      Amazon IVS has no service-specific constraints beyond what is documented
      there.</p> <p>Tags can help you identify and organize your Amazon Web
      Services resources. For example, you can use the same tag for different
      resources to indicate that they are related. You can also use tags to
      manage access (see <a
      href="https://docs.aws.amazon.com/IAM/latest/UserGuide/access_tags.html">
      Access Tags</a>). </p> <p>The Amazon IVS API has these tag-related
      endpoints: <a>TagResource</a>, <a>UntagResource</a>, and
      <a>ListTagsForResource</a>. The following resources support tagging:
      Channels, Stream Keys, Playback Key Pairs, and Recording
      Configurations.</p> <p>At most 50 tags can be applied to a resource. </p>
      <p> <b>Authentication versus Authorization</b> </p> <p>Note the
      differences between these concepts:</p> <ul> <li> <p>
      <i>Authentication</i> is about verifying identity. You need to be
      authenticated to sign Amazon IVS API requests.</p> </li> <li> <p>
      <i>Authorization</i> is about granting permissions. Your IAM roles need to
      have permissions for Amazon IVS API requests. In addition, authorization
      is needed to view <a
      href="https://docs.aws.amazon.com/ivs/latest/userguide/private-channels.html">Amazon
      IVS private channels</a>. (Private channels are channels that are enabled
      for "playback authorization.")</p> </li> </ul> <p> <b>Authentication</b>
      </p> <p>All Amazon IVS API requests must be authenticated with a
      signature. The Amazon Web Services Command-Line Interface (CLI) and Amazon
      IVS Player SDKs take care of signing the underlying API calls for you.
      However, if your application calls the Amazon IVS API directly, it’s your
      responsibility to sign the requests.</p> <p>You generate a signature using
      valid Amazon Web Services credentials that have permission to perform the
      requested action. For example, you must sign PutMetadata requests with a
      signature generated from a user account that has the
      <code>ivs:PutMetadata</code> permission.</p> <p>For more information:</p>
      <ul> <li> <p>Authentication and generating signatures — See <a
      href="https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonS3/latest/API/sig-v4-authenticating-requests.html">Authenticating
      Requests (Amazon Web Services Signature Version 4)</a> in the <i>Amazon
      Web Services General Reference</i>.</p> </li> <li> <p>Managing Amazon IVS
      permissions — See <a
      href="https://docs.aws.amazon.com/ivs/latest/userguide/security-iam.html">Identity
      and Access Management</a> on the Security page of the <i>Amazon IVS User
      Guide</i>.</p> </li> </ul> <p> <b>Amazon Resource Names (ARNs)</b> </p>
      <p>ARNs uniquely identify AWS resources. An ARN is required when you need
      to specify a resource unambiguously across all of AWS, such as in IAM
      policies and API calls. For more information, see <a
      href="https://docs.aws.amazon.com/general/latest/gr/aws-arns-and-namespaces.html">Amazon
      Resource Names</a> in the <i>AWS General Reference</i>.</p> <p> <b>Channel
      Endpoints</b> </p> <ul> <li> <p> <a>CreateChannel</a> — Creates a new
      channel and an associated stream key to start streaming.</p> </li> <li>
      <p> <a>GetChannel</a> — Gets the channel configuration for the specified
      channel ARN.</p> </li> <li> <p> <a>BatchGetChannel</a> — Performs
      <a>GetChannel</a> on multiple ARNs simultaneously.</p> </li> <li> <p>
      <a>ListChannels</a> — Gets summary information about all channels in your
      account, in the Amazon Web Services region where the API request is
      processed. This list can be filtered to match a specified name or
      recording-configuration ARN. Filters are mutually exclusive and cannot be
      used together. If you try to use both filters, you will get an error (409
      Conflict Exception).</p> </li> <li> <p> <a>UpdateChannel</a> — Updates a
      channel's configuration. This does not affect an ongoing stream of this
      channel. You must stop and restart the stream for the changes to take

      <p> <b>Introduction</b> </p> <p>The Amazon IVS Chat control-plane API
      enables you to create and manage Amazon IVS Chat resources. You also need
      to integrate with the <a
      href="https://docs.aws.amazon.com/ivs/latest/chatmsgapireference/chat-messaging-api.html">
      Amazon IVS Chat Messaging API</a>, to enable users to interact with chat
      rooms in real time.</p> <p>The API is an AWS regional service. For a list
      of supported regions and Amazon IVS Chat HTTPS service endpoints, see the
      Amazon IVS Chat information on the <a
      href="https://docs.aws.amazon.com/general/latest/gr/ivs.html">Amazon IVS
      page</a> in the <i>AWS General Reference</i>. </p> <p> <b>Notes on
      terminology:</b> </p> <ul> <li> <p>You create service applications using
      the Amazon IVS Chat API. We refer to these as <i>applications</i>.</p>
      </li> <li> <p>You create front-end client applications (browser and
      Android/iOS apps) using the Amazon IVS Chat Messaging API. We refer to
      these as <i>clients</i>. </p> </li> </ul> <p> <b>Resources</b> </p> <p>The
      following resources are part of Amazon IVS Chat:</p> <ul> <li> <p>
      <b>LoggingConfiguration</b> — A configuration that allows customers to
      store and record sent messages in a chat room. See the Logging
      Configuration endpoints for more information.</p> </li> <li> <p>
      <b>Room</b> — The central Amazon IVS Chat resource through which clients
      connect to and exchange chat messages. See the Room endpoints for more
      information.</p> </li> </ul> <p> <b>Tagging</b> </p> <p>A <i>tag</i> is a
      metadata label that you assign to an AWS resource. A tag comprises a
      <i>key</i> and a <i>value</i>, both set by you. For example, you might set
      a tag as <code>topic:nature</code> to label a particular video category.
      See <a
      href="https://docs.aws.amazon.com/general/latest/gr/aws_tagging.html">Tagging
      AWS Resources</a> for more information, including restrictions that apply
      to tags and "Tag naming limits and requirements"; Amazon IVS Chat has no
      service-specific constraints beyond what is documented there.</p> <p>Tags
      can help you identify and organize your AWS resources. For example, you
      can use the same tag for different resources to indicate that they are
      related. You can also use tags to manage access (see <a
      href="https://docs.aws.amazon.com/IAM/latest/UserGuide/access_tags.html">Access
      Tags</a>).</p> <p>The Amazon IVS Chat API has these tag-related endpoints:
      <a>TagResource</a>, <a>UntagResource</a>, and <a>ListTagsForResource</a>.
      The following resource supports tagging: Room.</p> <p>At most 50 tags can
      be applied to a resource.</p> <p> <b>API Access Security</b> </p> <p>Your
      Amazon IVS Chat applications (service applications and clients) must be
      authenticated and authorized to access Amazon IVS Chat resources. Note the
      differences between these concepts:</p> <ul> <li> <p>
      <i>Authentication</i> is about verifying identity. Requests to the Amazon
      IVS Chat API must be signed to verify your identity.</p> </li> <li> <p>
      <i>Authorization</i> is about granting permissions. Your IAM roles need to
      have permissions for Amazon IVS Chat API requests.</p> </li> </ul>
      <p>Users (viewers) connect to a room using secure access tokens that you
      create using the <a>CreateChatToken</a> endpoint through the AWS SDK. You
      call CreateChatToken for every user’s chat session, passing identity and
      authorization information about the user.</p> <p> <b>Signing API
      Requests</b> </p> <p>HTTP API requests must be signed with an AWS SigV4
      signature using your AWS security credentials. The AWS Command Line
      Interface (CLI) and the AWS SDKs take care of signing the underlying API
      calls for you. However, if your application calls the Amazon IVS Chat HTTP
      API directly, it’s your responsibility to sign the requests.</p> <p>You
      generate a signature using valid AWS credentials for an IAM role that has
      permission to perform the requested action. For example, DeleteMessage
      requests must be made using an IAM role that has the
      <code>ivschat:DeleteMessage</code> permission.</p> <p>For more
      information:</p> <ul> <li> <p>Authentication and generating signatures —
      See <a
      href="https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonS3/latest/API/sig-v4-authenticating-requests.html">Authenticating
      Requests (Amazon Web Services Signature Version 4)</a> in the <i>Amazon
      Web Services General Reference</i>.</p> </li> <li> <p>Managing Amazon IVS
      permissions — See <a
      href="https://docs.aws.amazon.com/ivs/latest/userguide/security-iam.html">Identity
      and Access Management</a> on the Security page of the <i>Amazon IVS User
      Guide</i>.</p> </li> </ul> <p> <b>Amazon Resource Names (ARNs)</b> </p>
      <p>ARNs uniquely identify AWS resources. An ARN is required when you need
      to specify a resource unambiguously across all of AWS, such as in IAM
      policies and API calls. For more information, see <a
      href="https://docs.aws.amazon.com/general/latest/gr/aws-arns-and-namespaces.html">Amazon
      Resource Names</a> in the <i>AWS General Reference</i>.</p> <p>
      <b>Messaging Endpoints</b> </p> <ul> <li> <p> <a>DeleteMessage</a> — Sends
      an event to a specific room which directs clients to delete a specific
      message; that is, unrender it from view and delete it from the client’s
      chat history. This event’s <code>EventName</code> is
      <code>aws:DELETE_MESSAGE</code>. This replicates the <a
      href="https://docs.aws.amazon.com/ivs/latest/chatmsgapireference/actions-deletemessage-publish.html">
      DeleteMessage</a> WebSocket operation in the Amazon IVS Chat Messaging
      API.</p> </li> <li> <p> <a>DisconnectUser</a> — Disconnects all
      connections using a specified user ID from a room. This replicates the <a
      href="https://docs.aws.amazon.com/ivs/latest/chatmsgapireference/actions-disconnectuser-publish.html">
      DisconnectUser</a> WebSocket operation in the Amazon IVS Chat Messaging
      API.</p> </li> <li> <p> <a>SendEvent</a> — Sends an event to a room. Use
      this within your application’s business logic to send events to clients of
      a room; e.g., to notify clients to change the way the chat UI is
      rendered.</p> </li> </ul> <p> <b>Chat Token Endpoint</b> </p> <ul> <li>
      <p> <a>CreateChatToken</a> — Creates an encrypted token that is used by a
      chat participant to establish an individual WebSocket chat connection to a
      room. When the token is used to connect to chat, the connection is valid
      for the session duration specified in the request. The token becomes
      invalid at the token-expiration timestamp included in the response.</p>
      </li> </ul> <p> <b>Room Endpoints</b> </p> <ul> <li> <p> <a>CreateRoom</a>
      — Creates a room that allows clients to connect and pass messages.</p>

      <li> <p> <a>GetRoom</a> — Gets the specified room.</p> </li> <li> <p>
      <a>ListRooms</a> — Gets summary information about all your rooms in the
      AWS region where the API request is processed. </p> </li> <li> <p>
      <a>UpdateRoom</a> — Updates a room’s configuration.</p> </li> </ul> <p>
      <b>Logging Configuration Endpoints</b> </p> <ul> <li> <p>
      <a>CreateLoggingConfiguration</a> — Creates a logging configuration that
      allows clients to store and record sent messages.</p> </li> <li> <p>
      <a>DeleteLoggingConfiguration</a> — Deletes the specified logging
      configuration.</p> </li> <li> <p> <a>GetLoggingConfiguration</a> — Gets
      the specified logging configuration.</p> </li> <li> <p>
      <a>ListLoggingConfigurations</a> — Gets summary information about all your
      logging configurations in the AWS region where the API request is
      processed.</p> </li> <li> <p> <a>UpdateLoggingConfiguration</a> — Updates
      a specified logging configuration.</p> </li> </ul> <p> <b>Tags
      Endpoints</b> </p> <ul> <li> <p> <a>ListTagsForResource</a> — Gets
      information about AWS tags for the specified ARN.</p> </li> <li> <p>
      <a>TagResource</a> — Adds or updates tags for the AWS resource with the
      specified ARN.</p> </li> <li> <p> <a>UntagResource</a> — Removes tags from
      the resource with the specified ARN.</p> </li> </ul> <p>All the above are
      HTTP operations. There is a separate <i>messaging</i> API for managing
      Chat resources; see the <a

      <p> <b>Introduction</b> </p> <p>The Amazon Interactive Video Service (IVS)
      real-time API is REST compatible, using a standard HTTP API and an AWS
      EventBridge event stream for responses. JSON is used for both requests and
      responses, including errors. </p> <p>Terminology:</p> <ul> <li> <p>A
      <i>stage</i> is a virtual space where participants can exchange video in
      real time.</p> </li> <li> <p>A <i>participant token</i> is a token that
      authenticates a participant when they join a stage.</p> </li> <li> <p>A
      <i>participant object</i> represents participants (people) in the stage
      and contains information about them. When a token is created, it includes
      a participant ID; when a participant uses that token to join a stage, the
      participant is associated with that participant ID. There is a 1:1 mapping
      between participant tokens and participants.</p> </li> <li> <p>Server-side
      composition: The <i>composition</i> process composites participants of a
      stage into a single video and forwards it to a set of outputs (e.g., IVS
      channels). Composition endpoints support this process.</p> </li> <li>
      <p>Server-side composition: A <i>composition</i> controls the look of the
      outputs, including how participants are positioned in the video.</p> </li>
      </ul> <p> <b>Resources</b> </p> <p>The following resources contain
      information about your IVS live stream (see <a
      href="https://docs.aws.amazon.com/ivs/latest/RealTimeUserGuide/getting-started.html">Getting
      Started with Amazon IVS Real-Time Streaming</a>):</p> <ul> <li> <p>
      <b>Stage</b> — A stage is a virtual space where participants can exchange
      video in real time.</p> </li> </ul> <p> <b>Tagging</b> </p> <p>A
      <i>tag</i> is a metadata label that you assign to an AWS resource. A tag
      comprises a <i>key</i> and a <i>value</i>, both set by you. For example,
      you might set a tag as <code>topic:nature</code> to label a particular
      video category. See <a

      endpoints: <a>TagResource</a>, <a>UntagResource</a>, and
      <a>ListTagsForResource</a>. The following resource supports tagging:
      Stage.</p> <p>At most 50 tags can be applied to a resource.</p> <p>
      <b>Stages Endpoints</b> </p> <ul> <li> <p> <a>CreateParticipantToken</a> —

    description: >-
      <fullname>Key Management Service</fullname> <p>Key Management Service
      (KMS) is an encryption and key management web service. This guide
      describes the KMS operations that you can call programmatically. For
      general information about KMS, see the <a
      href="https://docs.aws.amazon.com/kms/latest/developerguide/"> <i>Key
      Management Service Developer Guide</i> </a>.</p> <note> <p>KMS has
      replaced the term <i>customer master key (CMK)</i> with <i>KMS key</i> and
      <i>KMS key</i>. The concept has not changed. To prevent breaking changes,
      KMS is keeping some variations of this term.</p> <p>Amazon Web Services
      provides SDKs that consist of libraries and sample code for various
      programming languages and platforms (Java, Ruby, .Net, macOS, Android,
      etc.). The SDKs provide a convenient way to create programmatic access to
      KMS and other Amazon Web Services services. For example, the SDKs take
      care of tasks such as signing requests (see below), managing errors, and
      retrying requests automatically. For more information about the Amazon Web
      Services SDKs, including how to download and install them, see <a
      href="http://aws.amazon.com/tools/">Tools for Amazon Web Services</a>.</p>
      </note> <p>We recommend that you use the Amazon Web Services SDKs to make
      programmatic API calls to KMS.</p> <p>If you need to use FIPS 140-2
      validated cryptographic modules when communicating with Amazon Web
      Services, use the FIPS endpoint in your preferred Amazon Web Services
      Region. For more information about the available FIPS endpoints, see <a
      href="https://docs.aws.amazon.com/general/latest/gr/kms.html#kms_region">Service
      endpoints</a> in the Key Management Service topic of the <i>Amazon Web
      Services General Reference</i>.</p> <p>All KMS API calls must be signed
      and be transmitted using Transport Layer Security (TLS). KMS recommends
      you always use the latest supported TLS version. Clients must also support
      cipher suites with Perfect Forward Secrecy (PFS) such as Ephemeral
      Diffie-Hellman (DHE) or Elliptic Curve Ephemeral Diffie-Hellman (ECDHE).
      Most modern systems such as Java 7 and later support these modes.</p> <p>
      <b>Signing Requests</b> </p> <p>Requests must be signed using an access
      key ID and a secret access key. We strongly recommend that you do not use
      your Amazon Web Services account root access key ID and secret access key
      for everyday work. You can use the access key ID and secret access key for
      an IAM user or you can use the Security Token Service (STS) to generate
      temporary security credentials and use those to sign requests. </p> <p>All
      KMS requests must be signed with <a
      href="https://docs.aws.amazon.com/general/latest/gr/signature-version-4.html">Signature
      Version 4</a>.</p> <p> <b>Logging API Requests</b> </p> <p>KMS supports
      CloudTrail, a service that logs Amazon Web Services API calls and related
      events for your Amazon Web Services account and delivers them to an Amazon
      S3 bucket that you specify. By using the information collected by
      CloudTrail, you can determine what requests were made to KMS, who made the
      request, when it was made, and so on. To learn more about CloudTrail,
      including how to turn it on and find your log files, see the <a
      href="https://docs.aws.amazon.com/awscloudtrail/latest/userguide/">CloudTrail
      User Guide</a>.</p> <p> <b>Additional Resources</b> </p> <p>For more
      information about credentials and request signing, see the following:</p>

      <p>You can use Amazon CloudWatch Logs to monitor, store, and access your

      retrieve the associated log data from CloudWatch Logs using the CloudWatch
      console. Alternatively, you can use CloudWatch Logs commands in the Amazon
      Web Services CLI, CloudWatch Logs API, or CloudWatch Logs SDK.</p> <p>You
      can use CloudWatch Logs to:</p> <ul> <li> <p> <b>Monitor logs from EC2
      instances in real time</b>: You can use CloudWatch Logs to monitor
      applications and systems using log data. For example, CloudWatch Logs can
      track the number of errors that occur in your application logs. Then, it
      can send you a notification whenever the rate of errors exceeds a
      threshold that you specify. CloudWatch Logs uses your log data for
      monitoring so no code changes are required. For example, you can monitor
      application logs for specific literal terms (such as
      "NullReferenceException"). You can also count the number of occurrences of
      a literal term at a particular position in log data (such as "404" status
      codes in an Apache access log). When the term you are searching for is
      found, CloudWatch Logs reports the data to a CloudWatch metric that you
      specify.</p> </li> <li> <p> <b>Monitor CloudTrail logged events</b>: You
      can create alarms in CloudWatch and receive notifications of particular
      API activity as captured by CloudTrail. You can use the notification to
      perform troubleshooting.</p> </li> <li> <p> <b>Archive log data</b>: You
      can use CloudWatch Logs to store your log data in highly durable storage.
      You can change the log retention setting so that any log events earlier
      than this setting are automatically deleted. The CloudWatch Logs agent
      helps to quickly send both rotated and non-rotated log data off of a host
      and into the log service. You can then access the raw log data when you
      need it.</p> </li> </ul>

      <fullname>AWS Marketplace Metering Service</fullname> <p>This reference
      provides descriptions of the low-level AWS Marketplace Metering Service
      API.</p> <p>AWS Marketplace sellers can use this API to submit usage data
      for custom usage dimensions.</p> <p>For information on the permissions you
      need to use this API, see <a
      href="https://docs.aws.amazon.com/marketplace/latest/userguide/iam-user-policy-for-aws-marketplace-actions.html">AWS
      Marketplace metering and entitlement API permissions</a> in the <i>AWS
      Marketplace Seller Guide.</i> </p> <p> <b>Submitting Metering Records</b>
      </p> <ul> <li> <p> <i>MeterUsage</i> - Submits the metering record for an
      AWS Marketplace product. <code>MeterUsage</code> is called from an EC2
      instance or a container running on EKS or ECS.</p> </li> <li> <p>
      <i>BatchMeterUsage</i> - Submits the metering record for a set of
      customers. <code>BatchMeterUsage</code> is called from a
      software-as-a-service (SaaS) application.</p> </li> </ul> <p> <b>Accepting
      New Customers</b> </p> <ul> <li> <p> <i>ResolveCustomer</i> - Called by a
      SaaS application during the registration process. When a buyer visits your
      website during the registration process, the buyer submits a Registration
      Token through the browser. The Registration Token is resolved through this
      API to obtain a <code>CustomerIdentifier</code> along with the
      <code>CustomerAWSAccountId</code> and <code>ProductCode</code>.</p> </li>
      </ul> <p> <b>Entitlement and Metering for Paid Container Products</b> </p>
      <ul> <li> <p>Paid container software products sold through AWS Marketplace
      must integrate with the AWS Marketplace Metering Service and call the
      <code>RegisterUsage</code> operation for software entitlement and
      metering. Free and BYOL products for Amazon ECS or Amazon EKS aren't
      required to call <code>RegisterUsage</code>, but you can do so if you want
      to receive usage data in your seller reports. For more information on
      using the <code>RegisterUsage</code> operation, see <a
      href="https://docs.aws.amazon.com/marketplace/latest/userguide/container-based-products.html">Container-Based
      Products</a>. </p> </li> </ul> <p> <code>BatchMeterUsage</code> API calls
      are captured by AWS CloudTrail. You can use Cloudtrail to verify that the
      SaaS metering records that you sent are accurate by searching for records
      with the <code>eventName</code> of <code>BatchMeterUsage</code>. You can
      also use CloudTrail to audit records over time. For more information, see
      the <i> <a
      href="http://docs.aws.amazon.com/awscloudtrail/latest/userguide/cloudtrail-concepts.html">AWS
      CloudTrail User Guide</a>.</i> </p>

      <p>This is the API Reference for Network Firewall. This guide is for
      developers who need detailed information about the Network Firewall API
      actions, data types, and errors. </p> <ul> <li> <p>The REST API requires
      you to handle connection details, such as calculating signatures, handling
      request retries, and error handling. For general information about using
      the Amazon Web Services REST APIs, see <a
      href="https://docs.aws.amazon.com/general/latest/gr/aws-apis.html">Amazon
      Web Services APIs</a>. </p> <p>To access Network Firewall using the REST
      API endpoint: <code>https://network-firewall.&lt;region&gt;.amazonaws.com
      </code> </p> </li> <li> <p>Alternatively, you can use one of the Amazon
      Web Services SDKs to access an API that's tailored to the programming
      language or platform that you're using. For more information, see <a
      href="http://aws.amazon.com/tools/#SDKs">Amazon Web Services SDKs</a>.</p>
      </li> <li> <p>For descriptions of Network Firewall features, including and
      step-by-step instructions on how to use them through the Network Firewall
      console, see the <a
      href="https://docs.aws.amazon.com/network-firewall/latest/developerguide/">Network
      Firewall Developer Guide</a>.</p> </li> </ul> <p>Network Firewall is a
      stateful, managed, network firewall and intrusion detection and prevention
      service for Amazon Virtual Private Cloud (Amazon VPC). With Network
      Firewall, you can filter traffic at the perimeter of your VPC. This
      includes filtering traffic going to and coming from an internet gateway,
      NAT gateway, or over VPN or Direct Connect. Network Firewall uses rules
      that are compatible with Suricata, a free, open source network analysis
      and threat detection engine. Network Firewall supports Suricata version
      6.0.9. For information about Suricata, see the <a
      href="https://suricata.io/">Suricata website</a>.</p> <p>You can use
      Network Firewall to monitor and protect your VPC traffic in a number of
      ways. The following are just a few examples: </p> <ul> <li> <p>Allow
      domains or IP addresses for known Amazon Web Services service endpoints,
      such as Amazon S3, and block all other forms of traffic.</p> </li> <li>
      <p>Use custom lists of known bad domains to limit the types of domain
      names that your applications can access.</p> </li> <li> <p>Perform deep
      packet inspection on traffic entering or leaving your VPC.</p> </li> <li>
      <p>Use stateful protocol detection to filter protocols like HTTPS,
      regardless of the port used.</p> </li> </ul> <p>To enable Network Firewall
      for your VPCs, you perform steps in both Amazon VPC and in Network
      Firewall. For information about using Amazon VPC, see <a
      href="https://docs.aws.amazon.com/vpc/latest/userguide/">Amazon VPC User
      Guide</a>.</p> <p>To start using Network Firewall, do the following: </p>
      <ol> <li> <p>(Optional) If you don't already have a VPC that you want to

      <fullname>AWS OpsWorks CM</fullname> <p>AWS OpsWorks for configuration
      management (CM) is a service that runs and manages configuration
      management servers. You can use AWS OpsWorks CM to create and manage AWS
      OpsWorks for Chef Automate and AWS OpsWorks for Puppet Enterprise servers,
      and add or remove nodes for the servers to manage.</p> <p> <b>Glossary of
      terms</b> </p> <ul> <li> <p> <b>Server</b>: A configuration management
      server that can be highly-available. The configuration management server
      runs on an Amazon Elastic Compute Cloud (EC2) instance, and may use
      various other AWS services, such as Amazon Relational Database Service
      (RDS) and Elastic Load Balancing. A server is a generic abstraction over
      the configuration manager that you want to use, much like Amazon RDS. In
      AWS OpsWorks CM, you do not start or stop servers. After you create
      servers, they continue to run until they are deleted.</p> </li> <li> <p>
      <b>Engine</b>: The engine is the specific configuration manager that you
      want to use. Valid values in this release include
      <code>ChefAutomate</code> and <code>Puppet</code>.</p> </li> <li> <p>
      <b>Backup</b>: This is an application-level backup of the data that the
      configuration manager stores. AWS OpsWorks CM creates an S3 bucket for
      backups when you launch the first server. A backup maintains a snapshot of
      a server's configuration-related attributes at the time the backup
      starts.</p> </li> <li> <p> <b>Events</b>: Events are always related to a
      server. Events are written during server creation, when health checks run,
      when backups are created, when system maintenance is performed, etc. When
      you delete a server, the server's events are also deleted.</p> </li> <li>
      <p> <b>Account attributes</b>: Every account has attributes that are
      assigned in the AWS OpsWorks CM database. These attributes store
      information about configuration limits (servers, backups, etc.) and your
      customer account. </p> </li> </ul> <p> <b>Endpoints</b> </p> <p>AWS
      OpsWorks CM supports the following endpoints, all HTTPS. You must connect
      to one of the following endpoints. Your servers can only be accessed or
      managed within the endpoint in which they are created.</p> <ul> <li>

      User Guide</a>.</p> <p> <b>Ensuring Idempotency</b> </p> <p>When you make
      a mutating API request, the request typically returns a result before the
      asynchronous workflows of the operation are complete. Operations might
      also time out or encounter other server issues before they're complete,
      even if the request already returned a result. This might make it
      difficult to determine whether the request succeeded. Moreover, you might
      need to retry the request multiple times to ensure that the operation
      completes successfully. However, if the original request and the
      subsequent retries are successful, the operation occurs multiple times.
      This means that you might create more resources than you intended.</p> <p>
      <i>Idempotency</i> ensures that an API request action completes no more
      than one time. With an idempotent request, if the original request action
      completes successfully, any subsequent retries complete successfully
      without performing any further actions. However, the result might contain
      updated information, such as the current creation status.</p> <p>The
      following lists of APIs are grouped according to methods that ensure
      idempotency.</p> <p> <b>Idempotent create APIs with a client token</b>
      </p> <p>The API actions in this list support idempotency with the use of a
      <i>client token</i>. The corresponding Amazon Web Services CLI commands
      also support idempotency using a client token. A client token is a unique,
      case-sensitive string of up to 64 ASCII characters. To make an idempotent
      API request using one of these actions, specify a client token in the
      request. We recommend that you <i>don't</i> reuse the same client token
      for other API requests. If you don’t provide a client token for these
      APIs, a default client token is automatically provided by SDKs.</p>
      <p>Given a request action that has succeeded:</p> <p>If you retry the
      request using the same client token and the same parameters, the retry
      succeeds without performing any further actions other than returning the
      original resource detail data in the response.</p> <p>If you retry the
      request using the same client token, but one or more of the parameters are
      different, the retry throws a <code>ValidationException</code> with an
      <code>IdempotentParameterMismatch</code> error.</p> <p>Client tokens
      expire eight hours after a request is made. If you retry the request with
      the expired token, a new resource is created.</p> <p>If the original
      resource is deleted and you retry the request, a new resource is

        Checks whether a team has `admin`, `push`, `maintain`, `triage`, or
        `pull` permission for a repository. Repositories inherited through a
        parent team will also be checked.


        You can also get information about the specified repository, including
        what permissions the team grants on it, by passing the following custom
        [media
        type](https://docs.github.com/enterprise-server@3.9/rest/overview/media-types/)
        via the `application/vnd.github.v3.repository+json` accept header.


        If a team doesn't have permission for the repository, you will receive a
        `404 Not Found` response status.


        If the repository is private, you must have at least `read` permission
        for that repository, and your token must have the `repo` or `admin:org`
        scope. Otherwise, you will receive a `404 Not Found` response status.


        **Note:** You can also specify a team by `org_id` and `team_id` using
        the route `GET

        **Note**: Passing new arrays of `users` and `teams` replaces their
        previous values.


        **Note**: The list of users, apps, and teams in total is limited to 100

      description: >-
        Renames a branch in a repository.


        **Note:** Although the API responds immediately, the branch rename
        process might take some extra time to complete in the background. You
        won't be able to push to the old branch name while the rename process is
        in progress. For more information, see "[Renaming a
        branch](https://docs.github.com/enterprise-server@3.9/github/administering-a-repository/renaming-a-branch)".


        The authenticated user must have push access to the branch. If the
        branch is the default branch, the authenticated user must also have
        admin or owner permissions.


        In order to rename the default branch, fine-grained access tokens also
        need the `administration:write` repository permission.

      summary: Create a check run
      description: >-
        Creates a new check run for a specific commit in a repository.


        To create a check run, you must use a GitHub App. OAuth apps and
        authenticated users are not able to create a check suite.


        In a check suite, GitHub limits the number of check runs with the same
        name to 1000. Once these check runs exceed 1000, GitHub will start to
        automatically delete older check runs.


        **Note:** The Checks API only looks for pushes in the repository where
        the check suite or check run were created. Pushes to a branch in a
        forked repository are not detected and return an empty `pull_requests`
        array.

                        code. Annotations are visible on GitHub in the
                        **Checks** and **Files changed** tab of the pull
                        request. The Checks API limits the number of annotations
                        to a maximum of 50 per API request. To create more than
                        50 annotations, you have to make multiple requests to
                        the [Update a check
                        run](https://docs.github.com/enterprise-server@3.9/rest/checks/runs#update-a-check-run)
                        endpoint. Each time you update the check run,
                        annotations are appended to the list of annotations that
                        already exist for the check run. GitHub Actions are
                        limited to 10 warning annotations and 10 error
                        annotations per step. For details about how you can view
                        annotations on GitHub, see "[About status

        **Note:** The Checks API only looks for pushes in the repository where

        OAuth app tokens and personal access tokens (classic) need the `repo`
        scope to use this endpoint on a private repository.

      summary: Delete a code scanning analysis from a repository
      description: >-
        Deletes a specified code scanning analysis from a repository.


        You can delete one analysis at a time.

        To delete a series of analyses, start with the most recent analysis and
        work backwards.

        Conceptually, the process is similar to the undo function in a text
        editor.


        When you list the analyses for a repository,

        one or more will be identified as deletable in the response:


        ```

        "deletable": true

        ```


        An analysis is deletable when it's the most recent in a set of analyses.

        Typically, a repository will have multiple sets of analyses

        for each enabled code scanning tool,

        where a set is determined by a unique combination of analysis values:


        * `ref`

        * `tool`

        * `category`


        If you attempt to delete an analysis that is not the most recent in a
        set,

        you'll get a 400 response with the message:


        ```

        Analysis specified is not deletable.

        ```


        The response from a successful `DELETE` operation provides you with

        two alternative URLs for deleting the next analysis in the set:

        `next_analysis_url` and `confirm_delete_url`.

        Use the `next_analysis_url` URL if you want to avoid accidentally
        deleting the final analysis

        in a set. This is a useful option if you want to preserve at least one
        analysis

        for the specified tool in your repository.

        Use the `confirm_delete_url` URL if you are content to remove all
        analyses for a tool.

        When you delete the last analysis in a set, the value of
        `next_analysis_url` and `confirm_delete_url`

        in the 200 response is `null`.


        As an example of the deletion process,

        let's imagine that you added a workflow that configured a particular
        code scanning tool

        to analyze the code in a repository. This tool has added 15 analyses:

        10 on the default branch, and another 5 on a topic branch.

        You therefore have two separate sets of analyses for this tool.

        You've now decided that you want to remove all of the analyses for the
        tool.

        To do this you must make 15 separate deletion requests.

        To start, you must find an analysis that's identified as deletable.

        Each set of analyses always has one that's identified as deletable.

        Having found the deletable analysis for one of the two sets,

        delete this analysis and then continue deleting the next analysis in the
        set until they're all deleted.

        Then repeat the process for the second set.

        The procedure therefore consists of a nested loop:


        **Outer loop**:

        * List the analyses for the repository, filtered by tool.

        * Parse this list to find a deletable analysis. If found:

          **Inner loop**:
          * Delete the identified analysis.
          * Parse the response for the value of `confirm_delete_url` and, if found, use this in the next iteration.

        The above process assumes that you want to remove all trace of the
        tool's analyses from the GitHub user interface, for the specified
        repository, and it therefore uses the `confirm_delete_url` value.
        Alternatively, you could use the `next_analysis_url` value, which would
        leave the last analysis in each set undeleted to avoid removing a tool's
        analysis entirely.

For troubleshooting information, see \"[Troubleshooting SARIF uploads](https://docs.github.com/enterprise-server@3.9/code-security/code-scanning/troubleshooting-sarif).\"\n\nThere are two places where you can upload code scanning results.\n - If you upload to a pull request, for example `--ref refs/pull/42/merge` or `--ref refs/pull/42/head`, then the results appear as alerts in a pull request check. For more information, see \"[Triaging code scanning alerts in pull requests](/code-security/secure-coding/triaging-code-scanning-alerts-in-pull-requests).\"\n - If you upload to a branch, for example `--ref refs/heads/my-branch`, then the results appear in the **Security** tab for your repository. For more information, see \"[Managing code scanning alerts for your repository](/code-security/secure-coding/managing-code-scanning-alerts-for-your-repository#viewing-the-alerts-for-a-repository).\"\n\nYou must compress the SARIF-formatted analysis data that you want to upload, using `gzip`, and then encode it as a Base64 format string. For example:\n\n```\ngzip -c analysis-data.sarif | base64 -w0\n```\n\nSARIF upload supports a maximum number of entries per the following data objects, and an analysis will be rejected if any of these objects is above its maximum value. For some objects, there are additional values over which the entries will be ignored while keeping the most important entries whenever applicable.\nTo get the most out of your analysis when it includes data above the supported limits, try to optimize the analysis configuration.

        This endpoint triggers
        [notifications](https://docs.github.com/enterprise-server@3.9/github/managing-subscriptions-and-notifications-on-github/about-notifications).
        Creating content too quickly using this endpoint may result in secondary
        rate limiting. For more information, see "[Rate limits for the
        API](https://docs.github.com/enterprise-server@3.9/rest/overview/rate-limits-for-the-rest-api#about-secondary-rate-limits)"
        and "[Best practices for using the REST
        API](https://docs.github.com/enterprise-server@3.9/rest/guides/best-practices-for-using-the-rest-api)."


        Adding an outside collaborator may be restricted by enterprise
        administrators. For more information, see "[Enforcing repository
        management policies in your
        enterprise](https://docs.github.com/enterprise-server@3.9/admin/policies/enforcing-policies-for-your-enterprise/enforcing-repository-management-policies-in-your-enterprise#enforcing-a-policy-for-inviting-outside-collaborators-to-repositories)."


        For more information on permission levels, see "[Repository permission
        levels for an
        organization](https://docs.github.com/enterprise-server@3.9/github/setting-up-and-managing-organizations-and-teams/repository-permission-levels-for-an-organization#permission-levels-for-repositories-owned-by-an-organization)".
        There are restrictions on which permissions can be granted to
        organization members when an organization base role is in place. In this
        case, the permission being given must be equal to or higher than the org
        base permission. Otherwise, the request will fail with:


        ```

        Cannot assign {member} permission of {role name}

        ```


        Note that, if you choose not to pass any parameters, you'll need to set
        `Content-Length` to zero when calling out to this endpoint. For more
        information, see "[HTTP
        method](https://docs.github.com/enterprise-server@3.9/rest/guides/getting-started-with-the-rest-api#http-method)."


        **Updating an existing collaborator's permission level**


        The endpoint can also be used to change the permissions of an existing
        collaborator without first removing and re-adding the collaborator. To
        change the permissions, use the same endpoint and pass a different
        `permission` parameter. The response will be a `204`, with no other
        indication that the permission level changed.

        Removes a collaborator from a repository.


        To use this endpoint, the authenticated user must either be an
        administrator of the repository or target themselves for removal.


        This endpoint also:

        - Cancels any outstanding invitations

        - Unasigns the user from any issues

        - Removes access to organization projects if the user is not an
        organization member and is not a collaborator on any other organization
        repositories.

        - Unstars the repository

        - Updates access permissions to packages


        Removing a user as a collaborator has the following effects on forks:
         - If the user had access to a fork through their membership to this repository, the user will also be removed from the fork.
         - If the user had their own fork of the repository, the fork will be deleted.
         - If the user still has read access to the repository, open pull requests by this user from a fork will be denied.

        **Note**: A user can still have access to the repository through
        organization permissions like base repository permissions.


        Although the API responds immediately, the additional permission updates
        might take some extra time to complete in the background.


        For more information on fork permissions, see "[About permissions and
        visibility of
        forks](https://docs.github.com/enterprise-server@3.9/pull-requests/collaborating-with-pull-requests/working-with-forks/about-permissions-and-visibility-of-forks)".

        `read`. To determine the role assigned to the

        collaborator, see the `role_name` attribute, which will provide the full
        role name, including custom roles. The

        `permissions` hash can also be used to determine which base level of
        access the collaborator has to the repository.

        **Signature verification object**


        The response will include a `verification` object that describes the
        result of verifying the commit's signature. The following fields are
        included in the `verification` object:


        | Name | Type | Description |

        | - | - | -- |

        | `verified` | `boolean` | Indicates whether GitHub considers the
        signature in this commit to be verified. |

        | `reason` | `string` | The reason for verified value. Possible values
        and their meanings are enumerated in table below. |

        | `signature` | `string` | The signature that was extracted from the
        commit. |

        | `payload` | `string` | The value that was signed. |


        These are the possible values for `reason` in the `verification` object:


        | Value | Description |

        | -- | -- |

        | `expired_key` | The key that made the signature is expired. |

        | `not_signing_key` | The "signing" flag is not among the usage flags in
        the GPG key that made the signature. |

        | `gpgverify_error` | There was an error communicating with the
        signature verification service. |

        | `gpgverify_unavailable` | The signature verification service is
        currently unavailable. |

        | `unsigned` | The object does not include a signature. |

        | `unknown_signature_type` | A non-PGP signature was found in the
        commit. |

        | `no_user` | No user was associated with the `committer` email address
        in the commit. |

        | `unverified_email` | The `committer` email address in the commit was
        associated with a user, but the email address is not verified on their
        account. |

        | `bad_email` | The `committer` email address in the commit is not
        included in the identities of the PGP key that made the signature. |

        | `unknown_key` | The key that made the signature has not been
        registered with any user's account. |

        | `malformed_signature` | There was an error parsing the signature. |

        | `invalid` | The signature could not be cryptographically verified
        using the key whose key-id was found in the signature. |

        | `valid` | None of the above errors applied, so the signature is
        considered to be verified. |

        Returns the contents of a single commit reference. You must have `read`
        access for the repository to use this endpoint.


        **Note:** If there are more than 300 files in the commit diff and the
        default JSON media type is requested, the response will include
        pagination link headers for the remaining files, up to a limit of 3000
        files. Each page contains the static commit information, and the only
        changes are to the file listing.


        This endpoint supports the following custom media types. For more
        information, see "[Media
        types](https://docs.github.com/enterprise-server@3.9/rest/using-the-rest-api/getting-started-with-the-rest-api#media-types)."
        Pagination query parameters are not supported for these media types.


        - **`application/vnd.github.diff`**: Returns the diff of the commit.
        Larger diffs may time out and return a 5xx status code.

        - **`application/vnd.github.patch`**: Returns the patch of the commit.
        Diffs with binary data will have no `patch` property. Larger diffs may
        time out and return a 5xx status code.

        - **`application/vnd.github.sha`**: Returns the commit's SHA-1 hash. You
        can use this endpoint to check if a remote reference's SHA-1 hash is the
        same as your local reference's SHA-1 hash by providing the local SHA-1
        reference as the ETag.


        **Signature verification object**


        The response will include a `verification` object that describes the
        result of verifying the commit's signature. The following fields are
        included in the `verification` object:


        | Name | Type | Description |

        | - | - | -- |

        | `verified` | `boolean` | Indicates whether GitHub considers the
        signature in this commit to be verified. |

        | `reason` | `string` | The reason for verified value. Possible values
        and their meanings are enumerated in table below. |

        | `signature` | `string` | The signature that was extracted from the
        commit. |

        | `payload` | `string` | The value that was signed. |


        These are the possible values for `reason` in the `verification` object:


        | Value | Description |

        | -- | -- |

        | `expired_key` | The key that made the signature is expired. |

        | `not_signing_key` | The "signing" flag is not among the usage flags in
        the GPG key that made the signature. |

        | `gpgverify_error` | There was an error communicating with the
        signature verification service. |

        | `gpgverify_unavailable` | The signature verification service is
        currently unavailable. |

        | `unsigned` | The object does not include a signature. |

        | `unknown_signature_type` | A non-PGP signature was found in the
        commit. |

        | `no_user` | No user was associated with the `committer` email address
        in the commit. |

        | `unverified_email` | The `committer` email address in the commit was
        associated with a user, but the email address is not verified on their
        account. |

        | `bad_email` | The `committer` email address in the commit is not
        included in the identities of the PGP key that made the signature. |

        | `unknown_key` | The key that made the signature has not been
        registered with any user's account. |

        | `malformed_signature` | There was an error parsing the signature. |

        | `invalid` | The signature could not be cryptographically verified
        using the key whose key-id was found in the signature. |

        | `valid` | None of the above errors applied, so the signature is
        considered to be verified. |

      description: >-
        Lists check runs for a commit ref. The `ref` can be a SHA, branch name,
        or a tag name.


        **Note:** The endpoints to manage checks only look for pushes in the
        repository where the check suite or check run were created. Pushes to a
        branch in a forked repository are not detected and return an empty
        `pull_requests` array.


        If there are more than 1000 check suites on a single git reference, this
        endpoint will limit check runs to the 1000 most recent check suites. To
        iterate over all possible check runs, use the [List check suites for a
        Git
        reference](https://docs.github.com/enterprise-server@3.9/rest/reference/checks#list-check-suites-for-a-git-reference)
        endpoint and provide the `check_suite_id` parameter to the [List check
        runs in a check
        suite](https://docs.github.com/enterprise-server@3.9/rest/reference/checks#list-check-runs-in-a-check-suite)
        endpoint.


        OAuth app tokens and personal access tokens (classic) need the `repo`
        scope to use this endpoint on a private repository.

        Lists check suites for a commit `ref`. The `ref` can be a SHA, branch
        name, or a tag name.


        **Note:** The endpoints to manage checks only look for pushes in the
        repository where the check suite or check run were created. Pushes to a
        branch in a forked repository are not detected and return an empty
        `pull_requests` array and a `null` value for `head_branch`.


        OAuth app tokens and personal access tokens (classic) need the `repo`
        scope to use this endpoint on a private repository.

  /repos/{owner}/{repo}/compare/{basehead}:
    get:
      summary: Compare two commits
      description: >-
        Compares two commits against one another. You can compare refs (branches
        or tags) and commit SHAs in the same repository, or you can compare refs
        and commit SHAs that exist in different repositories within the same
        repository network, including fork branches. For more information about
        how to view a repository's network, see "[Understanding connections
        between
        repositories](https://docs.github.com/enterprise-server@3.9/repositories/viewing-activity-and-data-for-your-repository/understanding-connections-between-repositories)."


        This endpoint is equivalent to running the `git log BASE..HEAD` command,
        but it returns commits in a different order. The `git log BASE..HEAD`
        command returns commits in reverse chronological order, whereas the API
        returns commits in chronological order.


        This endpoint supports the following custom media types. For more
        information, see "[Media
        types](https://docs.github.com/enterprise-server@3.9/rest/using-the-rest-api/getting-started-with-the-rest-api#media-types)."


        - **`application/vnd.github.diff`**: Returns the diff of the commit.

        - **`application/vnd.github.patch`**: Returns the patch of the commit.
        Diffs with binary data will have no `patch` property.


        The API response includes details about the files that were changed
        between the two commits. This includes the status of the change (if a
        file was added, removed, modified, or renamed), and details of the
        change itself. For example, files with a `renamed` status have a
        `previous_filename` field showing the previous filename of the file, and
        files with a `modified` status have a `patch` field showing the changes
        made to the file.


        When calling this endpoint without any paging parameter (`per_page` or
        `page`), the returned list is limited to 250 commits, and the last
        commit in the list is the most recent of the entire comparison.


        **Working with large comparisons**


        To process a response with a large number of commits, use a query
        parameter (`per_page` or `page`) to paginate the results. When using
        pagination:


        - The list of changed files is only shown on the first page of results,
        but it includes all changed files for the entire comparison.

        - The results are returned in chronological order, but the last commit
        in the returned list may not be the most recent one in the entire set if
        there are more pages of results.


        For more information on working with pagination, see "[Using pagination
        in the REST
        API](https://docs.github.com/enterprise-server@3.9/rest/guides/using-pagination-in-the-rest-api)."


        **Signature verification object**


        The response will include a `verification` object that describes the
        result of verifying the commit's signature. The `verification` object
        includes the following fields:


        | Name | Type | Description |

        | - | - | -- |

        | `verified` | `boolean` | Indicates whether GitHub considers the
        signature in this commit to be verified. |

        | `reason` | `string` | The reason for verified value. Possible values
        and their meanings are enumerated in table below. |

        | `signature` | `string` | The signature that was extracted from the
        commit. |

        | `payload` | `string` | The value that was signed. |


        These are the possible values for `reason` in the `verification` object:


        | Value | Description |

        | -- | -- |

        | `expired_key` | The key that made the signature is expired. |

        | `not_signing_key` | The "signing" flag is not among the usage flags in
        the GPG key that made the signature. |

        | `gpgverify_error` | There was an error communicating with the
        signature verification service. |

        | `gpgverify_unavailable` | The signature verification service is
        currently unavailable. |

        | `unsigned` | The object does not include a signature. |

        | `unknown_signature_type` | A non-PGP signature was found in the
        commit. |

        | `no_user` | No user was associated with the `committer` email address
        in the commit. |

        | `unverified_email` | The `committer` email address in the commit was
        associated with a user, but the email address is not verified on their
        account. |

        | `bad_email` | The `committer` email address in the commit is not
        included in the identities of the PGP key that made the signature. |

        | `unknown_key` | The key that made the signature has not been
        registered with any user's account. |

        | `malformed_signature` | There was an error parsing the signature. |

        | `invalid` | The signature could not be cryptographically verified
        using the key whose key-id was found in the signature. |

        | `valid` | None of the above errors applied, so the signature is
        considered to be verified. |

        Gets the contents of a file or directory in a repository. Specify the
        file path or directory with the `path` parameter. If you omit the `path`
        parameter, you will receive the contents of the repository's root
        directory.


        This endpoint supports the following custom media types. For more
        information, see "[Media
        types](https://docs.github.com/enterprise-server@3.9/rest/using-the-rest-api/getting-started-with-the-rest-api#media-types)."


        - **`application/vnd.github.raw+json`**: Returns the raw file contents
        for files and symlinks.

        - **`application/vnd.github.html+json`**: Returns the file contents in
        HTML. Markup languages are rendered to HTML using GitHub's open-source
        [Markup library](https://github.com/github/markup).

        - **`application/vnd.github.object+json`**: Returns the contents in a
        consistent object format regardless of the content type. For example,
        instead of an array of objects for a directory, the response will be an
        object with an `entries` attribute containing the array of objects.


        If the content is a directory, the response will be an array of objects,
        one object for each item in the directory. When listing the contents of
        a directory, submodules have their "type" specified as "file".
        Logically, the value _should_ be "submodule". This behavior exists [for
        backwards compatibility purposes](https://git.io/v1YCW). In the next
        major version of the API, the type will be returned as "submodule".


        If the content is a symlink and the symlink's target is a normal file in
        the repository, then the API responds with the content of the file.
        Otherwise, the API responds with an object describing the symlink
        itself.


        If the content is a submodule, the `submodule_git_url` field identifies
        the location of the submodule repository, and the `sha` identifies a
        specific commit within the submodule repository. Git uses the given URL
        when cloning the submodule repository, and checks out the submodule at
        that specific commit. If the submodule repository is not hosted on
        github.com, the Git URLs (`git_url` and `_links["git"]`) and the
        github.com URLs (`html_url` and `_links["html"]`) will have null values.


        **Notes**:


        - To get a repository's contents recursively, you can [recursively get
        the
        tree](https://docs.github.com/enterprise-server@3.9/rest/git/trees#get-a-tree).

        - This API has an upper limit of 1,000 files for a directory. If you
        need to retrieve

        more files, use the [Git Trees
        API](https://docs.github.com/enterprise-server@3.9/rest/git/trees#get-a-tree).

        - Download URLs expire and are meant to be used just once. To ensure the
        download URL does not expire, please use the contents API to obtain a
        fresh download URL for each download.

        - If the requested file's size is:
          - 1 MB or smaller: All features of this endpoint are supported.
          - Between 1-100 MB: Only the `raw` or `object` custom media types are supported. Both will work as normal, except that when using the `object` media type, the `content` field will be an empty
        string and the `encoding` field will be `"none"`. To get the contents of
        these larger files, use the `raw` media type.
          - Greater than 100 MB: This endpoint is not supported.

        **Note:** If you use this endpoint and the "[Delete a
        file](https://docs.github.com/enterprise-server@3.9/rest/repos/contents/#delete-a-file)"
        endpoint in parallel, the concurrent requests will conflict and you will
        receive errors. You must use these endpoints serially instead.


        OAuth app tokens and personal access tokens (classic) need the `repo`
        scope to use this endpoint. The `workflow` scope is also required in
        order to modify files in the `.github/workflows` directory.

        You can provide an additional `committer` parameter, which is an object
        containing information about the committer. Or, you can provide an
        `author` parameter, which is an object containing information about the
        author.


        The `author` section is optional and is filled in with the `committer`
        information if omitted. If the `committer` information is omitted, the
        authenticated user's information is used.


        You must provide values for both `name` and `email`, whether you choose
        to use `author` or `committer`. Otherwise, you'll receive a `422` status
        code.

    post:
      summary: Create a deployment
      description: >-
        Deployments offer a few configurable parameters with certain defaults.


        The `ref` parameter can be any named branch, tag, or SHA. At GitHub
        Enterprise Server we often deploy branches and verify them

        before we merge a pull request.


        The `environment` parameter allows deployments to be issued to different
        runtime environments. Teams often have

        multiple environments for verifying their applications, such as
        `production`, `staging`, and `qa`. This parameter

        makes it easier to track which environments have requested deployments.
        The default environment is `production`.


        The `auto_merge` parameter is used to ensure that the requested ref is
        not behind the repository's default branch. If

        the ref _is_ behind the default branch for the repository, we will
        attempt to merge it for you. If the merge succeeds,

        the API will return a successful merge commit. If merge conflicts
        prevent the merge from succeeding, the API will

        return a failure response.


        By default, [commit
        statuses](https://docs.github.com/enterprise-server@3.9/rest/commits/statuses)
        for every submitted context must be in a `success`

        state. The `required_contexts` parameter allows you to specify a subset
        of contexts that must be `success`, or to

        specify contexts that have not yet been submitted. You are not required
        to use commit statuses to deploy. If you do

        not require any contexts or create any commit statuses, the deployment
        will always succeed.


        The `payload` parameter is available for any extra information that a
        deployment system might need. It is a JSON text

        field that will be passed on when a deployment event is dispatched.


        The `task` parameter is used by the deployment system to allow different
        execution paths. In the web world this might

        be `deploy:migrations` to run schema changes on the system. In the
        compiled world this could be a flag to compile an

        application with debugging enabled.


        Merged branch response:


        You will see this response when GitHub automatically merges the base
        branch into the topic branch instead of creating

        a deployment. This auto-merge happens when:

        *   Auto-merge option is enabled in the repository

        *   Topic branch does not include the latest changes on the base branch,
        which is `master` in the response example

        *   There are no merge conflicts


        If there are no new commits in the base branch, a new request to create
        a deployment should give a successful

        response.


        Merge conflict response:


        This error happens when the `auto_merge` option is enabled and when the
        default branch (in this case `master`), can't

        be merged into the branch that's being deployed (in this case
        `topic-branch`), due to merge conflicts.


        Failed commit status checks:


        This error happens when the `required_contexts` parameter indicates that
        one or more contexts need to have a `success`

        status for the commit to be deployed, but one or more of the required
        contexts do not have a state of `success`.


        OAuth app tokens and personal access tokens (classic) need the `repo` or
        `repo_deployment` scope to use this endpoint.

      summary: Delete a deployment
      description: >-
        If the repository only has one deployment, you can delete the deployment
        regardless of its status. If the repository has more than one
        deployment, you can only delete inactive deployments. This ensures that
        repositories with multiple deployments will always have an active
        deployment.


        To set a deployment as inactive, you must:


        *   Create a new deployment that is active so that the system has a
        record of the current state, then delete the previously active
        deployment.

        *   Mark the active deployment as inactive by adding any non-successful
        deployment status.


        For more information, see "[Create a
        deployment](https://docs.github.com/enterprise-server@3.9/rest/deployments/deployments/#create-a-deployment)"

      summary: Create a repository dispatch event
      description: >-
        You can use this endpoint to trigger a webhook event called
        `repository_dispatch` when you want activity that happens outside of
        GitHub Enterprise Server to trigger a GitHub Actions workflow or GitHub
        App webhook. You must configure your GitHub Actions workflow or GitHub
        App to run when the `repository_dispatch` event occurs. For an example
        `repository_dispatch` webhook payload, see
        "[RepositoryDispatchEvent](https://docs.github.com/enterprise-server@3.9/webhooks/event-payloads/#repository_dispatch)."


        The `client_payload` parameter is available for any extra information
        that your workflow might need. This parameter is a JSON payload that
        will be passed on when the webhook event is dispatched. For example, the
        `client_payload` can include a message that a user would like to send
        using a GitHub Actions workflow. Or the `client_payload` can be used as
        a test to debug your workflow.


        This input example shows how you can use the `client_payload` as a test
        to debug your workflow.

        **Note**: Forking a Repository happens asynchronously. You may have to
        wait a short period of time before you can access the git objects. If
        this takes longer than 5 minutes, be sure to contact [GitHub Enterprise
        Server
        Support](https://support.github.com/contact?tags=dotcom-rest-api).


        **Note**: Although this endpoint works with GitHub Apps, the GitHub App
        must be installed on the destination account with access to all
        repositories and on the source account with access to the source
        repository.

        **Signature verification object**


        The response will include a `verification` object that describes the
        result of verifying the commit's signature. The following fields are
        included in the `verification` object:


        | Name | Type | Description |

        | - | - | -- |

        | `verified` | `boolean` | Indicates whether GitHub considers the
        signature in this commit to be verified. |

        | `reason` | `string` | The reason for verified value. Possible values
        and their meanings are enumerated in the table below. |

        | `signature` | `string` | The signature that was extracted from the
        commit. |

        | `payload` | `string` | The value that was signed. |


        These are the possible values for `reason` in the `verification` object:


        | Value | Description |

        | -- | -- |

        | `expired_key` | The key that made the signature is expired. |

        | `not_signing_key` | The "signing" flag is not among the usage flags in
        the GPG key that made the signature. |

        | `gpgverify_error` | There was an error communicating with the
        signature verification service. |

        | `gpgverify_unavailable` | The signature verification service is
        currently unavailable. |

        | `unsigned` | The object does not include a signature. |

        | `unknown_signature_type` | A non-PGP signature was found in the
        commit. |

        | `no_user` | No user was associated with the `committer` email address
        in the commit. |

        | `unverified_email` | The `committer` email address in the commit was
        associated with a user, but the email address is not verified on their
        account. |

        | `bad_email` | The `committer` email address in the commit is not
        included in the identities of the PGP key that made the signature. |

        | `unknown_key` | The key that made the signature has not been
        registered with any user's account. |

        | `malformed_signature` | There was an error parsing the signature. |

        | `invalid` | The signature could not be cryptographically verified
        using the key whose key-id was found in the signature. |

        | `valid` | None of the above errors applied, so the signature is
        considered to be verified. |

                    of the commit. GitHub adds the signature to the `gpgsig`
                    header of the created commit. For a commit signature to be
                    verifiable by Git or GitHub, it must be an ASCII-armored
                    detached PGP signature over the string commit as it would be
                    written to the object database. To pass a `signature`
                    parameter, you need to first manually create a valid PGP
                    signature, which can be complicated. You may find it easier

        Returns an array of references from your Git database that match the
        supplied name. The `:ref` in the URL must be formatted as `heads/<branch
        name>` for branches and `tags/<tag name>` for tags. If the `:ref`
        doesn't exist in the repository, but existing refs start with `:ref`,
        they will be returned as an array.


        When you use this endpoint without providing a `:ref`, it will return an
        array of all the references from your Git database, including notes and
        stashes if they exist on the server. Anything in the namespace is
        returned, not just `heads` and `tags`.


        **Note:** You need to explicitly [request a pull
        request](https://docs.github.com/enterprise-server@3.9/rest/pulls/pulls#get-a-pull-request)
        to trigger a test merge commit, which checks the mergeability of pull
        requests. For more information, see "[Checking mergeability of pull
        requests](https://docs.github.com/enterprise-server@3.9/rest/guides/getting-started-with-the-git-database-api#checking-mergeability-of-pull-requests)".


        If you request matching references for a branch named `feature` but the
        branch `feature` doesn't exist, the response can still include other
        matching head refs that start with the word `feature`, such as
        `featureA` and `featureB`.

        Note that creating a tag object does not create the reference that makes
        a tag in Git. If you want to create an annotated tag in Git, you have to
        do this call to create the tag object, and then
        [create](https://docs.github.com/enterprise-server@3.9/rest/git/refs#create-a-reference)
        the `refs/tags/[tag]` reference. If you want to create a lightweight

        the tag reference - this call would be unnecessary.


        **Signature verification object**


        The response will include a `verification` object that describes the
        result of verifying the commit's signature. The following fields are
        included in the `verification` object:


        | Name | Type | Description |

        | - | - | -- |

        | `verified` | `boolean` | Indicates whether GitHub considers the
        signature in this commit to be verified. |

        and their meanings are enumerated in table below. |

        | `signature` | `string` | The signature that was extracted from the
        commit. |

        | `payload` | `string` | The value that was signed. |


        These are the possible values for `reason` in the `verification` object:


        | Value | Description |

        | -- | -- |

        | `expired_key` | The key that made the signature is expired. |

        | `not_signing_key` | The "signing" flag is not among the usage flags in
        the GPG key that made the signature. |

        | `gpgverify_error` | There was an error communicating with the
        signature verification service. |

        | `gpgverify_unavailable` | The signature verification service is
        currently unavailable. |

        | `unsigned` | The object does not include a signature. |

        | `unknown_signature_type` | A non-PGP signature was found in the
        commit. |

        | `no_user` | No user was associated with the `committer` email address
        in the commit. |

        | `unverified_email` | The `committer` email address in the commit was
        associated with a user, but the email address is not verified on their
        account. |

        | `bad_email` | The `committer` email address in the commit is not
        included in the identities of the PGP key that made the signature. |

        | `unknown_key` | The key that made the signature has not been
        registered with any user's account. |

        | `malformed_signature` | There was an error parsing the signature. |

        | `invalid` | The signature could not be cryptographically verified
        using the key whose key-id was found in the signature. |

        | `valid` | None of the above errors applied, so the signature is
        considered to be verified. |

      summary: Create a tree
      description: >-
        The tree creation API accepts nested entries. If you specify both a tree
        and a nested path modifying that tree, this endpoint will overwrite the
        contents of the tree with the new path contents, and create a new tree
        structure.


        If you use this endpoint to add, delete, or modify the file contents in
        a tree, you will need to commit the tree and then update a branch to
        point to the commit. For more information see "[Create a
        commit](https://docs.github.com/enterprise-server@3.9/rest/git/commits#create-a-commit)"
        and "[Update a
        reference](https://docs.github.com/enterprise-server@3.9/rest/git/refs#update-a-reference)."


        Returns an error if you try to delete a file that does not exist.

        List issues in a repository. Only open issues will be listed.


        **Note**: GitHub's REST API considers every pull request an issue, but
        not every issue is a pull request. For this

        reason, "Issues" endpoints may return both issues and pull requests in
        the response. You can identify pull requests by

        the `pull_request` key. Be aware that the `id` of a pull request
        returned from "Issues" endpoints will be an _issue id_. To find out the
        pull

        request id, use the "[List pull
        requests](https://docs.github.com/enterprise-server@3.9/rest/pulls/pulls#list-pull-requests)"
        endpoint.


        This endpoint supports the following custom media types. For more
        information, see "[Media
        types](https://docs.github.com/enterprise-server@3.9/rest/using-the-rest-api/getting-started-with-the-rest-api#media-types)."


        - **`application/vnd.github.raw+json`**: Returns the raw markdown body.
        Response will include `body`. This is the default if you do not pass any
        specific media type.

        - **`application/vnd.github.text+json`**: Returns a text only
        representation of the markdown body. Response will include `body_text`.

        - **`application/vnd.github.html+json`**: Returns HTML rendered from the
        body's markdown. Response will include `body_html`.

        - **`application/vnd.github.full+json`**: Returns raw, text, and HTML
        representations. Response will include `body`, `body_text`, and
        `body_html`.

        The API returns a [`301 Moved Permanently`
        status](https://docs.github.com/enterprise-server@3.9/rest/guides/best-practices-for-using-the-rest-api#follow-redirects)
        if the issue was

        [transferred](https://docs.github.com/enterprise-server@3.9/articles/transferring-an-issue-to-another-repository/)
        to another repository. If

        the issue was transferred to or deleted from a repository where the
        authenticated user lacks read access, the API

        returns a `404 Not Found` status. If the issue was deleted from a
        repository where the authenticated user has read

        access, the API returns a `410 Gone` status. To receive webhook events
        for transferred and deleted issues, subscribe

        to the
        [`issues`](https://docs.github.com/enterprise-server@3.9/webhooks/event-payloads/#issues)
        webhook.


        **Note**: GitHub's REST API considers every pull request an issue, but
        not every issue is a pull request. For this

        reason, "Issues" endpoints may return both issues and pull requests in
        the response. You can identify pull requests by

        the `pull_request` key. Be aware that the `id` of a pull request
        returned from "Issues" endpoints will be an _issue id_. To find out the
        pull

        request id, use the "[List pull
        requests](https://docs.github.com/enterprise-server@3.9/rest/pulls/pulls#list-pull-requests)"
        endpoint.


        This endpoint supports the following custom media types. For more

        - **`application/vnd.github.raw+json`**: Returns the raw markdown body.
        Response will include `body`. This is the default if you do not pass any
        specific media type.

        representation of the markdown body. Response will include `body_text`.

      summary: Request a GitHub Enterprise Server Pages build
      description: >-
        You can request that your site be built from the latest revision on the
        default branch. This has the same effect as pushing a commit to your
        default branch, but does not require an additional commit. Manually
        triggering page builds can be helpful when diagnosing build warnings and
        failures.


        Build requests are limited to one concurrent build per repository and
        one concurrent build per requester. If you request a build while another
        is still in progress, the second request will be queued until the first
        completes.

      summary: Get a pull request
      description: >-
        Draft pull requests are available in public repositories with GitHub
        Free and GitHub Free for organizations, GitHub Pro, and legacy
        per-repository billing plans, and in public and private repositories
        with GitHub Team and GitHub Enterprise Cloud. For more information, see
        [GitHub's
        products](https://docs.github.com/enterprise-server@3.9/github/getting-started-with-github/githubs-products)
        in the GitHub Help documentation.


        Lists details of a pull request by providing its number.


        When you get,
        [create](https://docs.github.com/enterprise-server@3.9/rest/pulls/pulls/#create-a-pull-request),
        or
        [edit](https://docs.github.com/enterprise-server@3.9/rest/pulls/pulls#update-a-pull-request)
        a pull request, GitHub Enterprise Server creates a merge commit to test
        whether the pull request can be automatically merged into the base
        branch. This test commit is not added to the base branch or the head
        branch. You can review the status of the test commit using the
        `mergeable` key. For more information, see "[Checking mergeability of
        pull
        requests](https://docs.github.com/enterprise-server@3.9/rest/guides/getting-started-with-the-git-database-api#checking-mergeability-of-pull-requests)".


        The value of the `mergeable` attribute can be `true`, `false`, or
        `null`. If the value is `null`, then GitHub Enterprise Server has
        started a background job to compute the mergeability. After giving the
        job time to complete, resubmit the request. When the job finishes, you
        will see a non-`null` value for the `mergeable` attribute in the
        response. If `mergeable` is `true`, then `merge_commit_sha` will be the
        SHA of the _test_ merge commit.


        The value of the `merge_commit_sha` attribute changes depending on the
        state of the pull request. Before merging a pull request, the
        `merge_commit_sha` attribute holds the SHA of the _test_ merge commit.
        After merging a pull request, the `merge_commit_sha` attribute changes
        depending on how you merged the pull request:


        *   If merged as a [merge
        commit](https://docs.github.com/enterprise-server@3.9/articles/about-merge-methods-on-github/),
        `merge_commit_sha` represents the SHA of the merge commit.

        *   If merged via a
        [squash](https://docs.github.com/enterprise-server@3.9/articles/about-merge-methods-on-github/#squashing-your-merge-commits),
        `merge_commit_sha` represents the SHA of the squashed commit on the base
        branch.

        *   If
        [rebased](https://docs.github.com/enterprise-server@3.9/articles/about-merge-methods-on-github/#rebasing-and-merging-your-commits),
        `merge_commit_sha` represents the commit that the base branch was
        updated to.


        Pass the appropriate [media
        type](https://docs.github.com/enterprise-server@3.9/rest/overview/media-types/#commits-commit-comparison-and-pull-requests)
        to fetch diff and patch formats.

        comment](https://docs.github.com/enterprise-server@3.9/rest/issues/comments#create-an-issue-comment)."


        If your comment applies to more than one line in the pull request diff,
        you should use the parameters `line`, `side`, and optionally
        `start_line` and `start_side` in your request.


        The `position` parameter is deprecated. If you use `position`, the
        `line`, `side`, `start_line`, and `start_side` parameters are not
        required.

        This endpoint triggers
        [notifications](https://docs.github.com/enterprise-server@3.9/github/managing-subscriptions-and-notifications-on-github/about-notifications).
        Creating content too quickly using this endpoint may result in secondary
        rate limiting. For more information, see "[Rate limits for the
        API](https://docs.github.com/enterprise-server@3.9/rest/overview/rate-limits-for-the-rest-api#about-secondary-rate-limits)"
        and "[Best practices for using the REST
        API](https://docs.github.com/enterprise-server@3.9/rest/guides/best-practices-for-using-the-rest-api)."


        Pull request reviews created in the `PENDING` state are not submitted
        and therefore do not include the `submitted_at` property in the
        response. To create a pending review for a pull request, leave the
        `event` parameter blank. For more information about submitting a
        `PENDING` review, see "[Submit a review for a pull
        request](https://docs.github.com/enterprise-server@3.9/rest/pulls/reviews#submit-a-review-for-a-pull-request)."


        **Note:** To comment on a specific line in a file, you need to first
        determine the position of that line in the diff. To see a pull request
        diff, add the `application/vnd.github.v3.diff` media type to the
        `Accept` header of a call to the [Get a pull
        request](https://docs.github.com/enterprise-server@3.9/rest/pulls/pulls#get-a-pull-request)
        endpoint.


        The `position` value equals the number of lines down from the first "@@"
        hunk header in the file you want to add a comment. The line just below
        the "@@" line is position 1, the next line is position 2, and so on. The
        position in the diff continues to increase through lines of whitespace
        and additional hunks until the beginning of a new file.

      summary: Upload a release asset
      description: >-
        This endpoint makes use of a [Hypermedia
        relation](https://docs.github.com/enterprise-server@3.9/rest/using-the-rest-api/getting-started-with-the-rest-api#hypermedia)
        to determine which URL to access. The endpoint you call to upload
        release assets is specific to your release. Use the `upload_url`
        returned in

        the response of the [Create a release
        endpoint](https://docs.github.com/enterprise-server@3.9/rest/releases/releases#create-a-release)
        to upload a release asset.


        You need to use an HTTP client which supports
        [SNI](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Server_Name_Indication) to make calls
        to this endpoint.


        Most libraries will set the required `Content-Length` header
        automatically. Use the required `Content-Type` header to provide the
        media type of the asset. For a list of media types, see [Media
        Types](https://www.iana.org/assignments/media-types/media-types.xhtml).
        For example: 


        `application/zip`


        GitHub Enterprise Server expects the asset data in its raw binary form,
        rather than JSON. You will send the raw binary content of the asset as
        the request body. Everything else about the endpoint is the same as the
        rest of the API. For example,

        you'll still need to pass your authentication to be able to upload an
        asset.


        When an upstream failure occurs, you will receive a `502 Bad Gateway`
        status. This may leave an empty asset with a state of `starter`. It can
        be safely deleted.


        **Notes:**

        *   GitHub Enterprise Server renames asset filenames that have special
        characters, non-alphanumeric characters, and leading or trailing
        periods. The "[List release
        assets](https://docs.github.com/enterprise-server@3.9/rest/releases/assets#list-release-assets)"

        endpoint lists the renamed filenames. For more information and help,
        contact [GitHub Enterprise Server
        Support](https://support.github.com/contact?tags=dotcom-rest-api).

        *   To find the `release_id` query the [`GET
        /repos/{owner}/{repo}/releases/latest`
        endpoint](https://docs.github.com/enterprise-server@3.9/rest/releases/releases#get-the-latest-release). 

        *   If you upload an asset with the same filename as another uploaded
        asset, you'll receive an error and must delete the old file before you
        can re-upload the new asset.

      summary: Create a commit status
      description: >-
        Users with push access in a repository can create commit statuses for a
        given SHA.


        Note: there is a limit of 1000 statuses per `sha` and `context` within a
        repository. Attempts to create more than 1000 statuses will result in a
        validation error.

        You must use a personal access token or an OAuth token for this

        Creates a new repository using a repository template. Use the

        scope to create a private repository.

        Find repositories via various criteria. This method returns up to 100
        results [per
        page](https://docs.github.com/enterprise-server@3.9/rest/guides/using-pagination-in-the-rest-api).


        When searching for repositories, you can get text match metadata for the
        **name** and **description** fields when you pass the `text-match` media
        type. For more details about how to receive highlighted search results,
        see [Text match
        metadata](https://docs.github.com/enterprise-server@3.9/rest/search/search#text-match-metadata).


        For example, if you want to search for popular Tetris repositories
        written in assembly code, your query might look like this:


        `q=tetris+language:assembly&sort=stars&order=desc`


        This query searches for repositories with the word `tetris` in the name,
        the description, or the README. The results are limited to repositories
        where the primary language is assembly. The results are sorted by stars
        in descending order, so that the most popular repositories appear first
        in the search results.

            The query contains one or more search keywords and qualifiers.

            as the web interface for GitHub Enterprise Server. To learn more
            about the format of the query, see [Constructing a search

            It looks like the new widget form is broken on Safari. When I try
            and create the widget, Safari crashes. This is reproducible on 10.8,
            but not 10.9. Maybe a browser bug?

        Lists provisioned SCIM groups in an enterprise.


        You can improve query search time by using the `excludedAttributes`
        query parameter with a value of `members` to exclude members from the
        response.

        Creates a SCIM group for an enterprise.


        If members are included as part of the group provisioning payload, they
        will be created as external group members. It is up to a provider to
        store a mapping between the `externalId` and `id` of each user.

        **Note:** The SCIM API endpoints for enterprise accounts are currently
        in *private* beta and are subject to change.


        Update a provisioned group’s individual attributes.


        To change a group’s values, you must provide a specific Operations JSON
        format that contains at least one of the add, remove, or replace
        operations. For examples and more information on the SCIM operations
        format, see the [SCIM
        specification](https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc7644#section-3.5.2). 
        Update can also be used to add group memberships.


        Group memberships can be sent one at a time or in batches for faster
        performance. **Note**: The memberships are referenced through a local
        user `id`, and the user will need to be created before they are
        referenced here.

        Lists provisioned SCIM enterprise members.


        When a user with a SCIM-provisioned external identity is removed from an
        enterprise through a `patch` with `active` flag set to `false`, the
        account's metadata is preserved to allow the user to re-join the
        enterprise in the future. However, the user's account will be suspended
        and the user will not be able to sign-in. In order to permanently
        suspend the users account with no ability to re-join the enterprise in
        the future, use the `delete` request. Users that were not permanently
        deleted will be visible in the returned results.

      summary: Provision a SCIM enterprise user

        **Note:** The SCIM API endpoints for enterprise accounts are currently
        in *private* beta and are subject to change.


        Creates an external identity for a new SCIM enterprise user.


        SCIM does not authenticate users, it only provisions them. The
        authentication of users is done by SAML. However, when SCIM is enabled,
        all users need to be provisioned through SCIM before a user can sign in
        through SAML. The matching of a user to a SCIM provisioned user is done
        when the SAML assertion is consumed. The user will be matched on SAML
        response `NameID` to SCIM `userName`.


        When converting existing enterprise to use SCIM, the user handle
        (`userName`) from the SCIM payload will be used to match the provisioned
        user to an already existing user in the enterprise. Since the new
        identity record is created for newly provisioned users the matching for
        those records is done using a user's handle. Currently the matching will
        be performed to all of the users no matter if they were SAML JIT
        provisioned or created as local users.

        Replaces an existing provisioned user's information.


        You must provide all the information required for the user as if you
        were provisioning them for the first time. Any existing user information
        that you don't provide will be removed. If you want to only update a
        specific attribute, use the [Update an attribute for a SCIM
        user](#update-an-attribute-for-a-scim-enterprise-user) endpoint instead.


        **Warning:** Setting `active: false` will suspend a user and obfuscate
        the user handle and user email. Since the implementation is a generic
        SCIM implementation and does not differentiate yet between different IdP
        providers, for Okta, the user GDPR data will not be purged and the
        credentials will not be removed.

        Update a provisioned user's individual attributes.


        To change a user's values, you must provide a specific `Operations` JSON
        format that contains at least one of the `add`, `remove`, or `replace`
        operations. For examples and more information on the SCIM operations
        format, see the [SCIM
        specification](https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc7644#section-3.5.2).


        **Note:** Complicated SCIM `path` selectors that include filters are not
        supported. For example, a `path` selector defined as `"path":
        "emails[type eq \"work\"]"` will not work.


        **Warning:** Setting `active: false` will suspend a user and obfuscate
        the user handle and user email. Since the implementation is a generic
        SCIM implementation and does not differentiate yet between different IdP
        providers, for Okta, the user GDPR data will not be purged and the
        credentials will not be removed.

        ```

        {
          "Operations":[{
            "op":"replace",
            "value":{
              "active":false
            }

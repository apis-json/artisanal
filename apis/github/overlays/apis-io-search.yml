      To create integrations, retrieve data, and automate your workflows, build
      with the GitHub REST API. When you make a request to the REST API, you
      will specify an HTTP method and a path. Additionally, you might also
      specify request headers and path, query, or body parameters. The API will
      return the response status code, response headers, and potentially a
      response body.

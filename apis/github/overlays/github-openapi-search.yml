    post:
      summary: Create an installation access token for an app
      description: >-
        Creates an installation access token that enables a GitHub App to make
        authenticated API requests for the app's installation on an organization
        or individual account. Installation tokens expire one hour from the time
        you create them. Using an expired token produces a status code of `401 -
        Unauthorized`, and requires creating a new installation token. By
        default the installation token has access to all repositories that the
        installation can access. 


        Optionally, you can use the `repositories` or `repository_ids` body
        parameters to specify individual repositories that the installation
        access token can access. If you don't use `repositories` or
        `repository_ids` to grant access to specific repositories, the
        installation access token will have access to all repositories that the
        installation was granted access to. The installation access token cannot
        be granted access to repositories that the installation was not granted
        access to. Up to 500 repositories can be listed in this manner.


        Optionally, use the `permissions` body parameter to specify the
        permissions that the installation access token should have. If
        `permissions` is not specified, the installation access token will have
        all of the permissions that were granted to the app. The installation
        access token cannot be granted permissions that the app was not granted.


        When using the repository or permission parameters to reduce the access
        of the token, the complexity of the token is increased due to both the
        number of permissions in the request and the number of repositories the
        token will have access to. If the complexity is too large, the token
        will fail to be issued. If this occurs, the error message will indicate
        the maximum number of repositories that should be requested. For the
        average application requesting 8 permissions, this limit is around 5000
        repositories. With fewer permissions requested, more repositories are
        supported.

        **Deprecation Notice:** GitHub Enterprise Server will discontinue the
        [OAuth Authorizations
        API](https://docs.github.com/enterprise-server@3.9/rest/oauth-authorizations/oauth-authorizations/),
        which is used by integrations to create personal access tokens and OAuth
        tokens, and you must now create these tokens using our [web application
        flow](https://docs.github.com/enterprise-server@3.9/developers/apps/authorizing-oauth-apps#web-application-flow).
        The [OAuth Authorizations
        API](https://docs.github.com/enterprise-server@3.9/rest/oauth-authorizations/oauth-authorizations)
        will be removed on November, 13, 2020. For more information, including
        scheduled brownouts, see the [blog
        post](https://developer.github.com/changes/2020-02-14-deprecating-oauth-auth-endpoint/).


        You can use this API to list the set of OAuth applications that have
        been granted access to your account. Unlike the [list your
        authorizations](https://docs.github.com/enterprise-server@3.9/rest/oauth-authorizations/oauth-authorizations#list-your-authorizations)
        API, this API does not manage individual tokens. This API will return
        one entry for each OAuth application that has been granted access to
        your account, regardless of the number of tokens an application has

        what is shown on [the application authorizations settings screen within

        scope and another token with `user` scope, the grant will return
        `["repo", "user"]`.

        If you have two-factor authentication setup, Basic Authentication for
        this endpoint requires that you use a one-time password (OTP) and your
        username and password instead of tokens. For more information, see
        "[Working with two-factor
        authentication](https://docs.github.com/enterprise-server@3.9/rest/overview/other-authentication-methods#working-with-two-factor-authentication)."


        To create tokens for a particular OAuth application using this endpoint,
        you must authenticate as the user you want to create an authorization
        for and provide the app's client ID and secret, found on your OAuth
        application's settings page. If your OAuth application intends to create
        multiple tokens for one user, use `fingerprint` to differentiate between
        them.


        You can also create tokens on GitHub Enterprise Server from the
        [personal access tokens settings](https://github.com/settings/tokens)
        page. Read more about these tokens in [the GitHub Help
        documentation](https://docs.github.com/enterprise-server@3.9/articles/creating-an-access-token-for-command-line-use).


        Organizations that enforce SAML SSO require personal access tokens to be
        allowed. For more information, see "[About identity and access
        management with SAML single
        sign-on](https://docs.github.com/enterprise-server@3.9/enterprise-cloud@latest/organizations/managing-saml-single-sign-on-for-your-organization/about-identity-and-access-management-with-saml-single-sign-on)"

        GitHub Enterprise Server provides several timeline resources in

        API lists all the feeds available to the authenticated user:


        *   **Timeline**: The GitHub Enterprise Server global public timeline

        *   **User**: The public timeline for any user, using `uri_template`.
        For more information, see
        "[Hypermedia](https://docs.github.com/enterprise-server@3.9/rest/using-the-rest-api/getting-started-with-the-rest-api#hypermedia)."

        *   **Current user public**: The public timeline for the authenticated
        user

        *   **Current user**: The private timeline for the authenticated user

        *   **Current user actor**: The private timeline for activity created by
        the authenticated user

        *   **Current user organizations**: The private timeline for the
        organizations the authenticated user is a member of.

        *   **Security advisories**: A collection of public announcements that
        provide information about security-related vulnerabilities in software
        on GitHub Enterprise Server.


        **Note**: Private feeds are only returned when [authenticating via Basic
        Auth](https://docs.github.com/enterprise-server@3.9/rest/overview/other-authentication-methods#basic-authentication)
        since current feed URIs use the older, non revocable auth tokens.

        You can restore a deleted package under the following conditions:
          - The package was deleted within the last 30 days.
          - The same package namespace and version is still available and not reused for a new package. If the same package namespace is not available, you will not be able to restore your package. In this scenario, to restore the deleted package, you must delete the new package that uses the deleted package's namespace first.

        Team synchronization is available for organizations using GitHub
        Enterprise Cloud. For more information, see [GitHub's
        products](https://docs.github.com/enterprise-server@3.9/github/getting-started-with-github/githubs-products)
        in the GitHub Help documentation.


        **Note:** When you have team synchronization set up for a team with your
        organization's identity provider (IdP), you will see an error if you
        attempt to use the API for making changes to the team's membership. If
        you have access to manage group membership in your IdP, you can manage
        GitHub Enterprise Server team membership through your identity provider,
        which automatically adds and removes team members in an organization.
        For more information, see "[Synchronizing teams between your identity
        provider and GitHub Enterprise
        Server](https://docs.github.com/enterprise-server@3.9/articles/synchronizing-teams-between-your-identity-provider-and-github/)."


        An organization owner can add someone who is not part of the team's
        organization to a team. When an organization owner adds someone to a
        team who is not an organization member, this endpoint will send an
        invitation to the person via email. This newly-created membership will
        be in the "pending" state until the person accepts the invitation, at
        which point the membership will transition to the "active" state and the
        user will be added as a member of the team.


        If the user is already a member of the team, this endpoint will update
        the role of the team member's role. To update the membership of a team
        member, the authenticated user must be an organization owner or a team
        maintainer.


        **Note:** You can also specify a team by `org_id` and `team_id` using
        the route `PUT
        /organizations/{org_id}/team/{team_id}/memberships/{username}`.

        does not delete the user, it just removes their membership from the

        Some categories of endpoints have custom rate limits that are separate
        from the rate limit governing the other REST API endpoints. For this
        reason, the API response categorizes your rate limit. Under `resources`,
        you'll see objects relating to different categories:

        * The `core` object provides your rate limit status for all
        non-search-related resources in the REST API.

        * The `search` object provides your rate limit status for the REST API
        for searching (excluding code searches). For more information, see
        "[Search](https://docs.github.com/enterprise-server@3.9/rest/search/search)."

        * The `code_search` object provides your rate limit status for the REST
        API for searching code. For more information, see "[Search
        code](https://docs.github.com/enterprise-server@3.9/rest/search/search#search-code)."

        * The `graphql` object provides your rate limit status for the GraphQL

        limitations](https://docs.github.com/enterprise-server@3.9/graphql/overview/resource-limitations#rate-limit)."

        * The `integration_manifest` object provides your rate limit status for

        Renames a branch in a repository.


        **Note:** Although the API responds immediately, the branch rename
        process might take some extra time to complete in the background. You
        won't be able to push to the old branch name while the rename process is
        in progress. For more information, see "[Renaming a
        branch](https://docs.github.com/enterprise-server@3.9/github/administering-a-repository/renaming-a-branch)".


        The authenticated user must have push access to the branch. If the
        branch is the default branch, the authenticated user must also have
        admin or owner permissions.


        In order to rename the default branch, fine-grained access tokens also
        need the `administration:write` repository permission.

        To create a check run, you must use a GitHub App. OAuth apps and
        authenticated users are not able to create a check suite.


        In a check suite, GitHub limits the number of check runs with the same
        name to 1000. Once these check runs exceed 1000, GitHub will start to
        automatically delete older check runs.


        **Note:** The Checks API only looks for pushes in the repository where
        the check suite or check run were created. Pushes to a branch in a
        forked repository are not detected and return an empty `pull_requests`
        array.

    delete:
      summary: Delete a code scanning analysis from a repository
      description: >-
        Deletes a specified code scanning analysis from a repository.


        You can delete one analysis at a time.

        To delete a series of analyses, start with the most recent analysis and
        work backwards.

        Conceptually, the process is similar to the undo function in a text
        editor.


        When you list the analyses for a repository,

        one or more will be identified as deletable in the response:


        ```

        "deletable": true

        ```


        An analysis is deletable when it's the most recent in a set of analyses.

        Typically, a repository will have multiple sets of analyses

        for each enabled code scanning tool,

        where a set is determined by a unique combination of analysis values:


        * `ref`

        * `tool`

        * `category`


        If you attempt to delete an analysis that is not the most recent in a
        set,

        you'll get a 400 response with the message:


        ```

        Analysis specified is not deletable.

        ```


        The response from a successful `DELETE` operation provides you with

        two alternative URLs for deleting the next analysis in the set:

        `next_analysis_url` and `confirm_delete_url`.

        Use the `next_analysis_url` URL if you want to avoid accidentally
        deleting the final analysis

        in a set. This is a useful option if you want to preserve at least one
        analysis

        for the specified tool in your repository.

        Use the `confirm_delete_url` URL if you are content to remove all
        analyses for a tool.

        When you delete the last analysis in a set, the value of
        `next_analysis_url` and `confirm_delete_url`

        in the 200 response is `null`.


        As an example of the deletion process,

        let's imagine that you added a workflow that configured a particular
        code scanning tool

        to analyze the code in a repository. This tool has added 15 analyses:

        10 on the default branch, and another 5 on a topic branch.

        You therefore have two separate sets of analyses for this tool.

        You've now decided that you want to remove all of the analyses for the
        tool.

        To do this you must make 15 separate deletion requests.

        To start, you must find an analysis that's identified as deletable.

        Each set of analyses always has one that's identified as deletable.

        Having found the deletable analysis for one of the two sets,

        delete this analysis and then continue deleting the next analysis in the
        set until they're all deleted.

        Then repeat the process for the second set.

        The procedure therefore consists of a nested loop:


        **Outer loop**:

        * List the analyses for the repository, filtered by tool.

        * Parse this list to find a deletable analysis. If found:

          **Inner loop**:
          * Delete the identified analysis.
          * Parse the response for the value of `confirm_delete_url` and, if found, use this in the next iteration.

        The above process assumes that you want to remove all trace of the
        tool's analyses from the GitHub user interface, for the specified
        repository, and it therefore uses the `confirm_delete_url` value.
        Alternatively, you could use the `next_analysis_url` value, which would
        leave the last analysis in each set undeleted to avoid removing a tool's
        analysis entirely.

        enterprise](https://docs.github.com/enterprise-server@3.9/admin/policies/enforcing-policies-for-your-enterprise/enforcing-repository-management-policies-in-your-enterprise#enforcing-a-policy-for-inviting-outside-collaborators-to-repositories)."


        For more information on permission levels, see "[Repository permission
        levels for an

        There are restrictions on which permissions can be granted to
        organization members when an organization base role is in place. In this
        case, the permission being given must be equal to or higher than the org
        base permission. Otherwise, the request will fail with:


        ```

        Cannot assign {member} permission of {role name}

        ```


        Note that, if you choose not to pass any parameters, you'll need to set
        `Content-Length` to zero when calling out to this endpoint. For more
        information, see "[HTTP
        method](https://docs.github.com/enterprise-server@3.9/rest/guides/getting-started-with-the-rest-api#http-method)."


        **Updating an existing collaborator's permission level**


        The endpoint can also be used to change the permissions of an existing
        collaborator without first removing and re-adding the collaborator. To
        change the permissions, use the same endpoint and pass a different
        `permission` parameter. The response will be a `204`, with no other
        indication that the permission level changed.

        Removes a collaborator from a repository.


        To use this endpoint, the authenticated user must either be an
        administrator of the repository or target themselves for removal.


        This endpoint also:

        - Cancels any outstanding invitations

        - Unasigns the user from any issues

        - Removes access to organization projects if the user is not an
        organization member and is not a collaborator on any other organization
        repositories.

        - Unstars the repository

        - Updates access permissions to packages


        Removing a user as a collaborator has the following effects on forks:
         - If the user had access to a fork through their membership to this repository, the user will also be removed from the fork.
         - If the user had their own fork of the repository, the fork will be deleted.
         - If the user still has read access to the repository, open pull requests by this user from a fork will be denied.

        **Note**: A user can still have access to the repository through
        organization permissions like base repository permissions.


        Although the API responds immediately, the additional permission updates
        might take some extra time to complete in the background.


        For more information on fork permissions, see "[About permissions and
        visibility of
        forks](https://docs.github.com/enterprise-server@3.9/pull-requests/collaborating-with-pull-requests/working-with-forks/about-permissions-and-visibility-of-forks)".

        *Note*: The `permission` attribute provides the legacy base roles of

        `maintain` role is mapped to `write` and the `triage` role is mapped to
        `read`. To determine the role assigned to the

        collaborator, see the `role_name` attribute, which will provide the full
        role name, including custom roles. The

        `permissions` hash can also be used to determine which base level of
        access the collaborator has to the repository.

        | Value | Description |

        | ----- | ----------- |

        | `expired_key` | The key that made the signature is expired. |

        | `not_signing_key` | The "signing" flag is not among the usage flags in
        the GPG key that made the signature. |

        | `gpgverify_error` | There was an error communicating with the
        signature verification service. |

        | `gpgverify_unavailable` | The signature verification service is

        in the commit. |

        | `unverified_email` | The `committer` email address in the commit was
        associated with a user, but the email address is not verified on their
        account. |

        | `bad_email` | The `committer` email address in the commit is not
        included in the identities of the PGP key that made the signature. |

        | `unknown_key` | The key that made the signature has not been
        registered with any user's account. |

        | `malformed_signature` | There was an error parsing the signature. |

        | `invalid` | The signature could not be cryptographically verified
        using the key whose key-id was found in the signature. |

        | `valid` | None of the above errors applied, so the signature is
        considered to be verified. |

      description: >-
        Compares two commits against one another. You can compare refs (branches
        or tags) and commit SHAs in the same repository, or you can compare refs
        and commit SHAs that exist in different repositories within the same
        repository network, including fork branches. For more information about
        how to view a repository's network, see "[Understanding connections
        between
        repositories](https://docs.github.com/enterprise-server@3.9/repositories/viewing-activity-and-data-for-your-repository/understanding-connections-between-repositories)."


        This endpoint is equivalent to running the `git log BASE..HEAD` command,
        but it returns commits in a different order. The `git log BASE..HEAD`
        command returns commits in reverse chronological order, whereas the API
        returns commits in chronological order.


        This endpoint supports the following custom media types. For more
        information, see "[Media
        types](https://docs.github.com/enterprise-server@3.9/rest/using-the-rest-api/getting-started-with-the-rest-api#media-types)."


        - **`application/vnd.github.diff`**: Returns the diff of the commit.

        - **`application/vnd.github.patch`**: Returns the patch of the commit.
        Diffs with binary data will have no `patch` property.


        The API response includes details about the files that were changed
        between the two commits. This includes the status of the change (if a
        file was added, removed, modified, or renamed), and details of the
        change itself. For example, files with a `renamed` status have a
        `previous_filename` field showing the previous filename of the file, and
        files with a `modified` status have a `patch` field showing the changes
        made to the file.


        When calling this endpoint without any paging parameter (`per_page` or
        `page`), the returned list is limited to 250 commits, and the last
        commit in the list is the most recent of the entire comparison.


        **Working with large comparisons**


        To process a response with a large number of commits, use a query
        parameter (`per_page` or `page`) to paginate the results. When using
        pagination:


        - The list of changed files is only shown on the first page of results,
        but it includes all changed files for the entire comparison.

        - The results are returned in chronological order, but the last commit
        in the returned list may not be the most recent one in the entire set if
        there are more pages of results.


        For more information on working with pagination, see "[Using pagination
        in the REST
        API](https://docs.github.com/enterprise-server@3.9/rest/guides/using-pagination-in-the-rest-api)."


        **Signature verification object**


        The response will include a `verification` object that describes the
        result of verifying the commit's signature. The `verification` object
        includes the following fields:


        | Name | Type | Description |

        | ---- | ---- | ----------- |

        | `verified` | `boolean` | Indicates whether GitHub considers the
        signature in this commit to be verified. |

        | `reason` | `string` | The reason for verified value. Possible values
        and their meanings are enumerated in table below. |

        | `signature` | `string` | The signature that was extracted from the
        commit. |

        | `payload` | `string` | The value that was signed. |


        These are the possible values for `reason` in the `verification` object:


        | Value | Description |

        | ----- | ----------- |

        | `expired_key` | The key that made the signature is expired. |

        | `not_signing_key` | The "signing" flag is not among the usage flags in
        the GPG key that made the signature. |

        | `gpgverify_error` | There was an error communicating with the
        signature verification service. |

        | `gpgverify_unavailable` | The signature verification service is
        currently unavailable. |

        | `unsigned` | The object does not include a signature. |

        | `unknown_signature_type` | A non-PGP signature was found in the
        commit. |

        | `no_user` | No user was associated with the `committer` email address
        in the commit. |

        | `unverified_email` | The `committer` email address in the commit was
        associated with a user, but the email address is not verified on their
        account. |

        | `bad_email` | The `committer` email address in the commit is not
        included in the identities of the PGP key that made the signature. |

        | `unknown_key` | The key that made the signature has not been
        registered with any user's account. |

        | `malformed_signature` | There was an error parsing the signature. |

        | `invalid` | The signature could not be cryptographically verified
        using the key whose key-id was found in the signature. |

        | `valid` | None of the above errors applied, so the signature is
        considered to be verified. |

    get:
      summary: Get repository content
      description: >-
        Gets the contents of a file or directory in a repository. Specify the
        file path or directory with the `path` parameter. If you omit the `path`
        parameter, you will receive the contents of the repository's root
        directory.


        This endpoint supports the following custom media types. For more
        information, see "[Media
        types](https://docs.github.com/enterprise-server@3.9/rest/using-the-rest-api/getting-started-with-the-rest-api#media-types)."


        - **`application/vnd.github.raw+json`**: Returns the raw file contents
        for files and symlinks.

        - **`application/vnd.github.html+json`**: Returns the file contents in
        HTML. Markup languages are rendered to HTML using GitHub's open-source
        [Markup library](https://github.com/github/markup).

        - **`application/vnd.github.object+json`**: Returns the contents in a
        consistent object format regardless of the content type. For example,
        instead of an array of objects for a directory, the response will be an
        object with an `entries` attribute containing the array of objects.


        If the content is a directory, the response will be an array of objects,
        one object for each item in the directory. When listing the contents of
        a directory, submodules have their "type" specified as "file".
        Logically, the value _should_ be "submodule". This behavior exists [for
        backwards compatibility purposes](https://git.io/v1YCW). In the next
        major version of the API, the type will be returned as "submodule".


        If the content is a symlink and the symlink's target is a normal file in
        the repository, then the API responds with the content of the file.
        Otherwise, the API responds with an object describing the symlink
        itself.


        If the content is a submodule, the `submodule_git_url` field identifies
        the location of the submodule repository, and the `sha` identifies a
        specific commit within the submodule repository. Git uses the given URL
        when cloning the submodule repository, and checks out the submodule at
        that specific commit. If the submodule repository is not hosted on
        github.com, the Git URLs (`git_url` and `_links["git"]`) and the
        github.com URLs (`html_url` and `_links["html"]`) will have null values.


        **Notes**:


        - To get a repository's contents recursively, you can [recursively get
        the
        tree](https://docs.github.com/enterprise-server@3.9/rest/git/trees#get-a-tree).

        - This API has an upper limit of 1,000 files for a directory. If you
        need to retrieve

        more files, use the [Git Trees
        API](https://docs.github.com/enterprise-server@3.9/rest/git/trees#get-a-tree).

        - Download URLs expire and are meant to be used just once. To ensure the
        download URL does not expire, please use the contents API to obtain a
        fresh download URL for each download.

        - If the requested file's size is:
          - 1 MB or smaller: All features of this endpoint are supported.
          - Between 1-100 MB: Only the `raw` or `object` custom media types are supported. Both will work as normal, except that when using the `object` media type, the `content` field will be an empty
        string and the `encoding` field will be `"none"`. To get the contents of
        these larger files, use the `raw` media type.
          - Greater than 100 MB: This endpoint is not supported.

        author.


        The `author` section is optional and is filled in with the `committer`
        information if omitted. If the `committer` information is omitted, the
        authenticated user's information is used.


        You must provide values for both `name` and `email`, whether you choose

      summary: Create a deployment
      description: >-
        Deployments offer a few configurable parameters with certain defaults.


        The `ref` parameter can be any named branch, tag, or SHA. At GitHub
        Enterprise Server we often deploy branches and verify them

        before we merge a pull request.


        The `environment` parameter allows deployments to be issued to different
        runtime environments. Teams often have

        multiple environments for verifying their applications, such as
        `production`, `staging`, and `qa`. This parameter

        makes it easier to track which environments have requested deployments.
        The default environment is `production`.


        The `auto_merge` parameter is used to ensure that the requested ref is
        not behind the repository's default branch. If

        the ref _is_ behind the default branch for the repository, we will
        attempt to merge it for you. If the merge succeeds,

        the API will return a successful merge commit. If merge conflicts
        prevent the merge from succeeding, the API will

        return a failure response.


        By default, [commit
        statuses](https://docs.github.com/enterprise-server@3.9/rest/commits/statuses)
        for every submitted context must be in a `success`

        state. The `required_contexts` parameter allows you to specify a subset
        of contexts that must be `success`, or to

        specify contexts that have not yet been submitted. You are not required
        to use commit statuses to deploy. If you do

        not require any contexts or create any commit statuses, the deployment
        will always succeed.


        The `payload` parameter is available for any extra information that a
        deployment system might need. It is a JSON text

        field that will be passed on when a deployment event is dispatched.


        The `task` parameter is used by the deployment system to allow different
        execution paths. In the web world this might

        be `deploy:migrations` to run schema changes on the system. In the
        compiled world this could be a flag to compile an

        application with debugging enabled.


        Merged branch response:


        You will see this response when GitHub automatically merges the base
        branch into the topic branch instead of creating

        a deployment. This auto-merge happens when:

        *   Auto-merge option is enabled in the repository

        *   Topic branch does not include the latest changes on the base branch,
        which is `master` in the response example

        *   There are no merge conflicts


        If there are no new commits in the base branch, a new request to create
        a deployment should give a successful

        response.


        Merge conflict response:


        This error happens when the `auto_merge` option is enabled and when the
        default branch (in this case `master`), can't

        be merged into the branch that's being deployed (in this case
        `topic-branch`), due to merge conflicts.


        Failed commit status checks:


        This error happens when the `required_contexts` parameter indicates that
        one or more contexts need to have a `success`

        status for the commit to be deployed, but one or more of the required
        contexts do not have a state of `success`.

        If the repository only has one deployment, you can delete the deployment

        deployment, you can only delete inactive deployments. This ensures that
        repositories with multiple deployments will always have an active
        deployment.


        To set a deployment as inactive, you must:


        *   Create a new deployment that is active so that the system has a
        record of the current state, then delete the previously active
        deployment.

        *   Mark the active deployment as inactive by adding any non-successful
        deployment status.

        GitHub Enterprise Server to trigger a GitHub Actions workflow or GitHub
        App webhook. You must configure your GitHub Actions workflow or GitHub

        `repository_dispatch` webhook payload, see
        "[RepositoryDispatchEvent](https://docs.github.com/enterprise-server@3.9/webhooks/event-payloads/#repository_dispatch)."


        The `client_payload` parameter is available for any extra information
        that your workflow might need. This parameter is a JSON payload that
        will be passed on when the webhook event is dispatched. For example, the
        `client_payload` can include a message that a user would like to send
        using a GitHub Actions workflow. Or the `client_payload` can be used as

        When you use this endpoint without providing a `:ref`, it will return an
        array of all the references from your Git database, including notes and
        stashes if they exist on the server. Anything in the namespace is

        If you request matching references for a branch named `feature` but the
        branch `feature` doesn't exist, the response can still include other

        **Signature verification object**


        The response will include a `verification` object that describes the
        result of verifying the commit's signature. The following fields are
        included in the `verification` object:


        | Name | Type | Description |

        | ---- | ---- | ----------- |

        | `verified` | `boolean` | Indicates whether GitHub considers the
        signature in this commit to be verified. |

        | `reason` | `string` | The reason for verified value. Possible values
        and their meanings are enumerated in table below. |

        | `signature` | `string` | The signature that was extracted from the
        commit. |

        | `payload` | `string` | The value that was signed. |


        These are the possible values for `reason` in the `verification` object:


        | Value | Description |

        | ----- | ----------- |

        | `expired_key` | The key that made the signature is expired. |

        | `not_signing_key` | The "signing" flag is not among the usage flags in
        the GPG key that made the signature. |

        | `gpgverify_error` | There was an error communicating with the
        signature verification service. |

        | `gpgverify_unavailable` | The signature verification service is
        currently unavailable. |

        | `unsigned` | The object does not include a signature. |

        | `unknown_signature_type` | A non-PGP signature was found in the
        commit. |

        | `no_user` | No user was associated with the `committer` email address
        in the commit. |

        | `unverified_email` | The `committer` email address in the commit was
        associated with a user, but the email address is not verified on their
        account. |

        | `bad_email` | The `committer` email address in the commit is not
        included in the identities of the PGP key that made the signature. |

        | `unknown_key` | The key that made the signature has not been
        registered with any user's account. |

        | `malformed_signature` | There was an error parsing the signature. |

        | `invalid` | The signature could not be cryptographically verified
        using the key whose key-id was found in the signature. |

        | `valid` | None of the above errors applied, so the signature is
        considered to be verified. |

      description: >-
        The tree creation API accepts nested entries. If you specify both a tree
        and a nested path modifying that tree, this endpoint will overwrite the
        contents of the tree with the new path contents, and create a new tree
        structure.


        If you use this endpoint to add, delete, or modify the file contents in
        a tree, you will need to commit the tree and then update a branch to
        point to the commit. For more information see "[Create a
        commit](https://docs.github.com/enterprise-server@3.9/rest/git/commits#create-a-commit)"
        and "[Update a
        reference](https://docs.github.com/enterprise-server@3.9/rest/git/refs#update-a-reference)."


        Returns an error if you try to delete a file that does not exist.

        If `truncated` is `true` in the response then the number of items in the

        items, use the non-recursive method of fetching trees, and fetch one
        sub-tree at a time.



        **Note**: The limit for the `tree` array is 100,000 entries with a
        maximum size of 7 MB when using the `recursive` parameter.

        When you get,
        [create](https://docs.github.com/enterprise-server@3.9/rest/pulls/pulls/#create-a-pull-request),
        or
        [edit](https://docs.github.com/enterprise-server@3.9/rest/pulls/pulls#update-a-pull-request)
        a pull request, GitHub Enterprise Server creates a merge commit to test
        whether the pull request can be automatically merged into the base
        branch. This test commit is not added to the base branch or the head
        branch. You can review the status of the test commit using the
        `mergeable` key. For more information, see "[Checking mergeability of
        pull
        requests](https://docs.github.com/enterprise-server@3.9/rest/guides/getting-started-with-the-git-database-api#checking-mergeability-of-pull-requests)".


        The value of the `mergeable` attribute can be `true`, `false`, or
        `null`. If the value is `null`, then GitHub Enterprise Server has
        started a background job to compute the mergeability. After giving the
        job time to complete, resubmit the request. When the job finishes, you
        will see a non-`null` value for the `mergeable` attribute in the
        response. If `mergeable` is `true`, then `merge_commit_sha` will be the
        SHA of the _test_ merge commit.


        The value of the `merge_commit_sha` attribute changes depending on the
        state of the pull request. Before merging a pull request, the
        `merge_commit_sha` attribute holds the SHA of the _test_ merge commit.
        After merging a pull request, the `merge_commit_sha` attribute changes
        depending on how you merged the pull request:


        *   If merged as a [merge
        commit](https://docs.github.com/enterprise-server@3.9/articles/about-merge-methods-on-github/),
        `merge_commit_sha` represents the SHA of the merge commit.

        *   If merged via a
        [squash](https://docs.github.com/enterprise-server@3.9/articles/about-merge-methods-on-github/#squashing-your-merge-commits),
        `merge_commit_sha` represents the SHA of the squashed commit on the base
        branch.

        *   If
        [rebased](https://docs.github.com/enterprise-server@3.9/articles/about-merge-methods-on-github/#rebasing-and-merging-your-commits),
        `merge_commit_sha` represents the commit that the base branch was
        updated to.


        Pass the appropriate [media
        type](https://docs.github.com/enterprise-server@3.9/rest/overview/media-types/#commits-commit-comparison-and-pull-requests)

        Pull request reviews created in the `PENDING` state are not submitted
        and therefore do not include the `submitted_at` property in the
        response. To create a pending review for a pull request, leave the
        `event` parameter blank. For more information about submitting a
        `PENDING` review, see "[Submit a review for a pull
        request](https://docs.github.com/enterprise-server@3.9/rest/pulls/reviews#submit-a-review-for-a-pull-request)."


        **Note:** To comment on a specific line in a file, you need to first
        determine the position of that line in the diff. To see a pull request
        diff, add the `application/vnd.github.v3.diff` media type to the
        `Accept` header of a call to the [Get a pull
        request](https://docs.github.com/enterprise-server@3.9/rest/pulls/pulls#get-a-pull-request)
        endpoint.


        The `position` value equals the number of lines down from the first "@@"
        hunk header in the file you want to add a comment. The line just below
        the "@@" line is position 1, the next line is position 2, and so on. The
        position in the diff continues to increase through lines of whitespace
        and additional hunks until the beginning of a new file.

        Most libraries will set the required `Content-Length` header
        automatically. Use the required `Content-Type` header to provide the
        media type of the asset. For a list of media types, see [Media
        Types](https://www.iana.org/assignments/media-types/media-types.xhtml).
        For example: 


        `application/zip`


        GitHub Enterprise Server expects the asset data in its raw binary form,
        rather than JSON. You will send the raw binary content of the asset as
        the request body. Everything else about the endpoint is the same as the
        rest of the API. For example,

        you'll still need to pass your authentication to be able to upload an
        asset.


        When an upstream failure occurs, you will receive a `502 Bad Gateway`
        status. This may leave an empty asset with a state of `starter`. It can
        be safely deleted.


        **Notes:**

        *   GitHub Enterprise Server renames asset filenames that have special
        characters, non-alphanumeric characters, and leading or trailing
        periods. The "[List release
        assets](https://docs.github.com/enterprise-server@3.9/rest/releases/assets#list-release-assets)"

        endpoint lists the renamed filenames. For more information and help,
        contact [GitHub Enterprise Server
        Support](https://support.github.com/contact?tags=dotcom-rest-api).

        *   To find the `release_id` query the [`GET
        /repos/{owner}/{repo}/releases/latest`
        endpoint](https://docs.github.com/enterprise-server@3.9/rest/releases/releases#get-the-latest-release). 

        *   If you upload an asset with the same filename as another uploaded
        asset, you'll receive an error and must delete the old file before you
        can re-upload the new asset.

        SCIM does not authenticate users, it only provisions them. The
        authentication of users is done by SAML. However, when SCIM is enabled,
        all users need to be provisioned through SCIM before a user can sign in
        through SAML. The matching of a user to a SCIM provisioned user is done
        when the SAML assertion is consumed. The user will be matched on SAML
        response `NameID` to SCIM `userName`.


        When converting existing enterprise to use SCIM, the user handle
        (`userName`) from the SCIM payload will be used to match the provisioned
        user to an already existing user in the enterprise. Since the new
        identity record is created for newly provisioned users the matching for
        those records is done using a user's handle. Currently the matching will
        be performed to all of the users no matter if they were SAML JIT
        provisioned or created as local users.

        You must provide all the information required for the user as if you
        were provisioning them for the first time. Any existing user information
        that you don't provide will be removed. If you want to only update a
        specific attribute, use the [Update an attribute for a SCIM
        user](#update-an-attribute-for-a-scim-enterprise-user) endpoint instead.


        **Warning:** Setting `active: false` will suspend a user and obfuscate
        the user handle and user email. Since the implementation is a generic
        SCIM implementation and does not differentiate yet between different IdP

        When searching for code, you can get text match metadata for the file
        **content** and file **path** fields when you pass the `text-match`
        media type. For more details about how to receive highlighted search
        results, see [Text match
        metadata](https://docs.github.com/enterprise-server@3.9/rest/search/search#text-match-metadata).


        For example, if you want to find the definition of the `addClass`
        function inside [jQuery](https://github.com/jquery/jquery) repository,
        your query would look something like this:


        `q=addClass+in:file+language:js+repo:jquery/jquery`


        This query searches for the keyword `addClass` within a file's contents.
        The query limits the search to files where the language is JavaScript in
        the `jquery/jquery` repository.


        Considerations for code search:


        Due to the complexity of searching code, there are a few restrictions on
        how searches are performed:


        *   Only the _default branch_ is considered. In most cases, this will be
        the `master` branch.

        *   Only files smaller than 384 KB are searchable.

        *   You must always include at least one search term when searching
        source code. For example, searching for
        [`language:go`](https://github.com/search?utf8=%E2%9C%93&q=language%3Ago&type=Code)
        is not valid, while [`amazing

        language:go`](https://github.com/search?utf8=%E2%9C%93&q=amazing+language%3Ago&type=Code)
        is.

        For example, if you want to find the oldest unresolved Python bugs on
        Windows. Your query might look something like this.


        `q=windows+label:bug+language:python+state:open&sort=created&order=asc`


        This query searches for the keyword `windows`, within any open issue
        that is labeled as `bug`. The search runs across repositories whose
        primary language is Python. The results are sorted by creation date in
        ascending order, which means the oldest issues appear first in the
        search results.


        **Note:** For requests made by GitHub Apps with a user access token, you
        can't retrieve a combination of issues and pull requests in a single
        query. Requests that don't include the `is:issue` or `is:pull-request`

        to start the actual configuration process.


        When using this endpoint, your GitHub instance must have a password set.
        This can be accomplished two ways:


        1.  If you're working directly with the API before accessing the web
        interface, you must pass in the password parameter to set your password.

        2.  If you set up your instance via the web interface before accessing
        the API, your calls to this endpoint do not need the password parameter.


        **Note:** The request body for this operation must be submitted as
        `multipart/form-data` data. You can can reference the license file by
        prefixing the filename with the `@` symbol using `curl`. For more

        Team synchronization is available for organizations using GitHub

        To add someone to a team, the authenticated user must be an organization
        owner or a team maintainer in the team they're changing. The person
        being added to the team must be a member of the team's organization.


        **Note:** When you have team synchronization set up for a team with your

        To remove a team member, the authenticated user must have 'admin'
        permissions to the team or be an owner of the org that the team is
        associated with. Removing a team member does not delete the user, it

        If the user is unaffiliated with the team's organization, this endpoint
        will send an invitation to the user via email. This newly-created
        membership will be in the "pending" state until the user accepts the
        invitation, at which point the membership will transition to the
        "active" state and the user will be added as a member of the team. To
        add a membership between an unaffiliated user and a team, the
        authenticated user must be an organization owner.


        If the user is already a member of the team, this endpoint will update
        the role of the team member's role. To update the membership of a team
        member, the authenticated user must be an organization owner or a team

        Removes an organization project from a team. An organization owner or a
        team maintainer can remove any project from the team. To remove a
        project from a team as an organization member, the authenticated user
        must have `read` access to both the team and project, or `admin` access
        to the team or project. **Note:** This endpoint removes the project from
        the team, but does not delete it.

        To add a repository to a team or update the team's permission on a
        repository, the authenticated user must have admin access to the
        repository, and must be able to see the team. The repository must be
        owned by the organization, or a direct fork of a repository owned by the
        organization. You will get a `422 Unprocessable Entity` status if you
        attempt to add a repository to a team that is not owned by the
        organization.

        For OAuth app tokens and personal access tokens (classic), this endpoint
        only lists organizations that your authorization allows you to operate
        on in some way (e.g., you can list teams with `read:org` scope, you can

        Therefore, this API requires at least `user` or `read:org` scope for

        Restores a specific package version for a user.


        You can restore a deleted package under the following conditions:
          - The package was deleted within the last 30 days.
          - The same package namespace and version is still available and not reused for a new package. If the same package namespace is not available, you will not be able to restore your package. In this scenario, to restore the deleted package, you must delete the new package that uses the deleted package's namespace first.

        If the `package_type` belongs to a GitHub Packages registry that
        supports granular permissions, the authenticated user must have admin
        permissions to the package. For the list of these registries, see
        "[About permissions for GitHub
        Packages](https://docs.github.com/enterprise-server@3.9/packages/learn-github-packages/about-permissions-for-github-packages#granular-permissions-for-userorganization-scoped-packages)."


        OAuth app tokens and personal access tokens (classic) need the
        `read:packages` and `write:packages` scopes to use this endpoint. If the
        `package_type` belongs to a GitHub Packages registry that only supports
        repository-scoped permissions, the `repo` scope is also required. For
        the list of these registries, see "[About permissions for GitHub
        Packages](https://docs.github.com/enterprise-server@3.9/packages/learn-github-packages/about-permissions-for-github-packages#permissions-for-repository-scoped-packages)."

        in the REST API documentation.


        For activity relating to check suites, use the `check-suite` event.


        To subscribe to this event, a GitHub App must have at least read-level
        access for the "Checks" repository permission. To receive the
        `rerequested` and `requested_action` event types, the app must have at
        least write-level access for the "Checks" permission. GitHub Apps with
        write-level access for the "Checks" permission are automatically
        subscribed to this webhook event.


        Repository and organization webhooks only receive payloads for the
        `created` and `completed` event types in repositories.


        **Note**: The API only looks for pushes in the repository where the
        check run was created. Pushes to a branch in a forked repository are not
        detected and return an empty `pull_requests` array and a `null` value
        for `head_branch`.

        **Notes**:

        - This event will not occur when more than three tags are created at
        once.

        - Payloads are capped at 25 MB. If an event generates a larger payload,
        GitHub will not deliver a payload for that webhook event. This may
        happen, for example, if many branches or tags are pushed at once. We
        suggest monitoring your payload size to ensure delivery.

        This event occurs when a user revokes their authorization of a GitHub
        App. For more information, see "[About
        apps](https://docs.github.com/enterprise-server@3.9/developers/apps/getting-started-with-apps/about-apps#about-github-apps)."

        A GitHub App receives this webhook by default and cannot unsubscribe
        from this event.


        Anyone can revoke their authorization of a GitHub App from their [GitHub
        account settings page](https://github.com/settings/apps/authorizations).
        Revoking the authorization of a GitHub App does not uninstall the GitHub
        App. You should program your GitHub App so that when it receives this
        webhook, it stops calling the API on behalf of the person who revoked
        the token. If your GitHub App continues to use a revoked access token,
        it will receive the `401 Bad Credentials` error. For details about
        requests with a user access token, which require GitHub App
        authorization, see "[Authenticating with a GitHub App on behalf of a
        user](https://docs.github.com/enterprise-server@3.9/apps/creating-github-apps/authenticating-with-a-github-app/authenticating-with-a-github-app-on-behalf-of-a-user)."

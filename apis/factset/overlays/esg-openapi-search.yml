        (*request IND_PCTL in scores endpoints*). Mapping of ESG Ranks to
        Industry Percentile Ranges is as follows - 


        |Rank|Industry Percentile Range (%)|

        |Leader|90 - 100|

        |Laggard|0 - 9.9|


        Industry classifications follow SICS, SASB's Industry Classification
        System. Using the Adjusted Insight scores, Industry Percentiles are
        generated for all companies. Companies with five or more articles in a
        year get ranked in a first pass, then companies with filled-in values
        are interpolated without forcing the ranking of higher-volume companies
        up or down.  In the case where a company falls into an industry with
        fewer than 7 high or medium volume companies the Sector Percentile is
        inserted in the place of the Industry Percentile score.

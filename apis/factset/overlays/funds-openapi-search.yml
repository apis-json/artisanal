        development level, and geographical region as described in each fund's

        on successively granular levels- category, then focus, and then niche.
        Moreover, FactSet Fund Reference captures over 40 unique data points for
        U.S. mutual funds. All data items are grouped in one of two levels,

        based on the fund's mandate.|

        |Economic Development Level|The country development level of the fund

        Get the Fund Flows. One-day fund flows are calculated by subtracting the
        shares outstanding at previous close from the shares outstanding one day
        prior to close, and then multiplying the result by the net asset value
        (NAV) of one day prior to close.


        The fund flows calculation breaks down as follows - 

        (Shares Outstanding T0 - Shares Outstanding T-1) * NAV T-1

        While NAVs are routinely reported on a trade-day (T0) basis,
        industry-wide shares outstanding are a mixture of trade-day and next-day
        values. Trade-day values are not verified, as the actual
        creation/redemption activity takes place late in the evening, after NAVs
        and shares outstanding values have been published. The result is that
        multiple industry flows are calculated using unverified T0 values.

        FactSet has standardized all shares outstanding reporting on a next-day
        basis. To ensure that assets under management (AUM) and fund flows are
        synchronized, FactSet synchronizes shares outstanding values and changes
        with NAVs reported on the previous day, as the creations and redemptions
        used the previous day's reported NAVs as a transaction price. <p>For

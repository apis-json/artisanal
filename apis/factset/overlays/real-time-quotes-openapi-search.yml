      summary: Basic search for notations.
      description: >-
        Search for a notation whose ISIN, specified NSINs, name, or symbol match
        the search value according to a tolerant full-text match algorithm. If
        more than one notation of an instrument matches, only the notation with
        the highest monetary trading volume, averaged over one month, is
        considered. Better matching results appear in the response before less
        relevant matches. If the parameter popularity is set to true, the
        popularity of the notation is the primary sort criterion. Popularity is
        affected mostly by the request frequency of the notation.

      summary: Text-based search for notations.
      description: >-
        Text-based search for notations in selected identifier and name
        attributes according to a tolerant full-text match algorithm. The
        results satisfy all selected filters; sorting by various attributes is
        possible. If more than one notation of an instrument matches, only the
        notation with the best market priority (according to the parameter
        `market.priority`) or, in the absence of market priorities, only the
        notation with the highest trading volume, averaged over one month, is
        considered.     
         All identifiers used as parameters must be valid and entitled.

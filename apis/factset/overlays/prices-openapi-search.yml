      summary: Gets the latest relative rollover date for the database.
      description: >
        Gets zero relative date and last update time for FactSet databases. The
        dates represent the date that the rollover event happened; the date and
        time is in **eastern time zone**.  <p>Depending on the ids requested and
        their respective regions, a requested startDate or endDate used in the
        various Prices API may reflect different previous close dates. This
        relative "zero" date, meaning - as of yesterday's close - will vary
        across global regions. This API is designed to help production systems
        account for regional rollover dates to know when to trigger their
        processes for different regions to reflect the latest close. The
        response gives context for AMERICAS, ASIA PACIFIC, and EUROPE. </p>

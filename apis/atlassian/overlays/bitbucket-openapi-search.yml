        Deletes the application for the user.

        This endpoint is intended to be used by Bitbucket Connect apps
        and only supports JWT authentication -- that is how Bitbucket
        identifies the particular installation of the app. Developers
        with applications registered in the "Develop Apps" section
        of Bitbucket Marketplace need not use this endpoint as
        updates for those applications can be sent out via the
        UI of that section.

        ```
        $ curl -X DELETE https://api.bitbucket.org/2.0/addon \
          -H "Authorization: JWT <JWT Token>"
        ```

        Updates the application installation for the user.

        This endpoint is intended to be used by Bitbucket Connect apps
        and only supports JWT authentication -- that is how Bitbucket
        identifies the particular installation of the app. Developers
        with applications registered in the "Develop Apps" section
        of Bitbucket need not use this endpoint as updates for those
        applications can be sent out via the UI of that section.

        Passing an empty body will update the installation using the
        existing descriptor URL.

        ```
        $ curl -X PUT https://api.bitbucket.org/2.0/addon \
          -H "Authorization: JWT <JWT Token>" \
          --header "Content-Type: application/json" \
          --data '{}'
        ```

        The new `descriptor` for the installation can be also provided
        in the body directly.

        ```
        $ curl -X PUT https://api.bitbucket.org/2.0/addon \
          -H "Authorization: JWT <JWT Token>" \
          --header "Content-Type: application/json" \
          --data '{"descriptor": $NEW_DESCRIPTOR}'
        ```

        In both these modes the URL of the descriptor cannot be changed. To
        change the descriptor location and upgrade an installation
        the request must be made exclusively with a `descriptor_url`.

         ```
        $ curl -X PUT https://api.bitbucket.org/2.0/addon \
          -H "Authorization: JWT <JWT Token>" \
          --header "Content-Type: application/json" \
          --data '{"descriptor_url": $NEW_URL}'
        ```

        The `descriptor_url` must exactly match the marketplace registration
        that Atlassian has for the application. Contact your Atlassian
        developer advocate to update this registration. Once the registration
        has been updated you may call this resource for each installation.

        Note that the scopes of the application cannot be increased
        in the new descriptor nor reduced to none.

        Since this endpoint can be used to both update and to create a

        #### Creation

        See the POST documentation for the repository endpoint for an example
        of the request body.

        #### Update

        Note: Changing the `name` of the repository will cause the location to
        be changed. This is because the URL of the repo is derived from the
        name (a process called slugification). In such a scenario, it is
        possible for the request to fail if the newly created slug conflicts
        with an existing repository's slug. But if there is no conflict,
        the new location will be returned in the `Location` header of the
        response.

        `kind` describes what will be restricted. Allowed values include:

        `push`, `force`, `delete`, `restrict_merges`,
        `require_tasks_to_be_completed`,

        `require_approvals_to_merge`,
        `require_default_reviewer_approvals_to_merge`,

        `require_no_changes_requested`, `require_passing_builds_to_merge`,

        `reset_pullrequest_approvals_on_change`,
        `smart_reset_pullrequest_approvals`,

        `reset_pullrequest_changes_requested_on_change`,
        `require_all_dependencies_merged`,

        `enforce_merge_checks`, and `allow_auto_merge_when_builds_pass`.


        Different kinds of branch restrictions have different requirements:


        * `push` and `restrict_merges` require `users` and `groups` to be
          specified. Empty lists are allowed, in which case permission is
          denied for everybody.

        The restriction applies to all branches that match. There are

        two ways to match a branch. It is configured in `branch_match_kind`:


        1. `glob`: Matches a branch against the `pattern`. A `'*'` in
           `pattern` will expand to match zero or more characters, and every
           other character matches itself. For example, `'foo*'` will match
           `'foo'` and `'foobar'`, but not `'barfoo'`. `'*'` will match all
           branches.
        2. `branching_model`: Matches a branch against the repository's
           branching model. The `branch_type` controls the type of branch
           to match. Allowed values include: `production`, `development`,
           `bugfix`, `release`, `feature` and `hotfix`.

        The combination of `kind` and match must be unique. This means that

        two `glob` restrictions in a repository cannot have the same `kind` and

        `pattern`. Additionally, two `branching_model` restrictions in a

        repository cannot have the same `kind` and `branch_type`.


        `users` and `groups` are lists of users and groups that are except from

        the restriction. They can only be configured in `push` and

        `restrict_merges` restrictions. The `push` restriction stops a user

        pushing to matching branches unless that user is in `users` or is a

        member of a group in `groups`. The `restrict_merges` stops a user

        merging pull requests to matching branches unless that user is in

        `users` or is a member of a group in `groups`. Adding new users or

        groups to an existing restriction should be done via `PUT`.


        Note that branch restrictions with overlapping matchers is allowed,

        but the resulting behavior may be surprising.

        The `development` branch can be configured to a specific branch or to
        track the main branch. When set to a specific branch it must
        currently exist. Only the passed properties will be updated. The
        properties not passed will be left unchanged. A request without a
        `development` property will leave the development branch unchanged.

        It is possible for the `development` branch to be invalid. This
        happens when it points at a specific branch that has been
        deleted. This is indicated in the `is_valid` field for the branch. It is
        not possible to update the settings for `development` if that
        would leave the branch in an invalid state. Such a request will be
        rejected.

        The `production` branch can be a specific branch, the main
        branch or disabled. When set to a specific branch it must currently
        exist. The `enabled` property can be used to enable (`true`) or
        disable (`false`) it. Only the passed properties will be updated. The
        properties not passed will be left unchanged. A request without a
        `production` property will leave the production branch unchanged.

        It is possible for the `production` branch to be invalid. This
        happens when it points at a specific branch that has been
        deleted. This is indicated in the `is_valid` field for the branch. A
        request that would leave `production` enabled and invalid will be
        rejected. It is possible to update `production` and make it invalid if
        it would also be left disabled.

        The `branch_types` property contains the branch types to be updated.
        Only the branch types passed will be updated. All updates will be
        rejected if it would leave the branching model in an invalid state.
        For branch types this means that:

        1. The prefixes for all enabled branch types are valid. For example,
           it is not possible to use '*' inside a Git prefix.
        2. A prefix of an enabled branch type must not be a prefix of another
           enabled branch type. This is to ensure that a branch can be easily
           classified by its prefix unambiguously.

        It is possible to store an invalid prefix if that branch type would be
        left disabled. Only the passed properties will be updated. The
        properties not passed will be left unchanged. Each branch type must
        have a `kind` property to identify it.

        There is currently a side effect when using this API endpoint. If the
        repository is inheriting branching model settings from its project,
        updating the branching model for this repository will disable the
        project setting inheritance.


        We have deprecated this side effect and will remove it on 1 August 2022.

        the repository. In contrast, just the fact that a repository is
        publicly accessible to users does not give them the ability to approve
        commits.

        Bulk upload of annotations.

        Annotations are individual findings that have been identified as part of
        a report, for example, a line of code that represents a vulnerability.
        These annotations can be attached to a specific file and even a specific
        line in that file, however, that is optional. Annotations are not
        mandatory and a report can contain up to 1000 annotations.


        Add the annotations you want to upload as objects in a JSON array and
        make sure each annotation has the external_id field set to a unique
        value. If you want to use an existing id from your own system, we
        recommend prefixing it with your system's name to avoid collisions, for
        example, mySystem-annotation001. The external id can later be used to
        identify the report as an alternative to the generated
        [UUID](https://developer.atlassian.com/bitbucket/api/2/reference/meta/uri-uuid#uuid).
        You can upload up to 100 annotations per POST request.


        ### Sample cURL request:

        ```

        curl --location
        'https://api.bitbucket.org/2.0/repositories/<username>/<reposity-name>/commit/<commit-hash>/reports/mysystem-001/annotations'

        If the specified key already exists, the existing status object will

        Example:


        ```

        https://api.bitbucket.org/2.0/repositories/my-workspace/my-repo/commit/e10dae226959c2194f2b07b077c07762d93821cf/statuses/build/

        ```


        When creating a new commit status, you can use a URI template for the
        URL.

        Templates are URLs that contain variable names that Bitbucket will

        evaluate at runtime whenever the URL is displayed anywhere similar to

        parameter substitution in

        [Bitbucket

        For example, one could use
        `https://foo.com/builds/{repository.full_name}`

        which Bitbucket will turn into `https://foo.com/builds/foo/bar` at
        render time.

        The context variables available are `repository` and `commit`.

        Like these tools, the DAG can be filtered.


        #### GET /repositories/{workspace}/{repo_slug}/commits/


        Returns all commits in the repo in topological order (newest commit

        first). All branches and tags are included (similar to

        Returns all commits that are on refs `foo` or `bar`, but not on `fu` or

        `fubar` (similar to `git log foo bar ^fu ^fubar`).


        An optional `path` parameter can be specified that will limit the

        results to commits that affect that path. `path` can either be a file

        or a directory. If a directory is specified, commits are returned that

        have modified any file in the directory tree rooted by `path`. It is

        important to note that if the `path` parameter is specified, the commits

        returned by this endpoint may no longer be a DAG, parent commits that

        do not modify the path will be omitted from the response.


        #### GET
        /repositories/{workspace}/{repo_slug}/commits/?path=README.md&include=foo&include=bar&exclude=master


        Returns all commits that are on refs `foo` or `bar`, but not on `master`

        that changed the file README.md.


        #### GET
        /repositories/{workspace}/{repo_slug}/commits/?path=src/&include=foo&include=bar&exclude=master

        that changed to a file in any file in the directory src or its children.


        Because the response could include a very large number of commits, it

        Produces a raw git-style diff.


        #### Single commit spec


        If the `spec` argument to this API is a single commit, the diff is

        produced against the first parent of the specified commit.


        #### Two commit spec


        Two commits separated by `..` may be provided as the `spec`, e.g.,

        `3a8b42..9ff173`. When two commits are provided and the `topic` query

        parameter is true, this API produces a 2-way three dot diff.

        This is the diff between source commit and the merge base of the source

        commit and the destination commit. When the `topic` query param is
        false,

        a simple git-style diff is produced.


        The two commits are interpreted as follows:


        * First commit: the commit containing the changes we wish to preview

        * Second commit: the commit representing the state to which we want to
          compare the first commit
        * **Note**: This is the opposite of the order used in `git diff`.


        #### Comparison to patches


        While similar to patches, diffs:


        * Don't have a commit header (username, commit message, etc)

        * Support the optional `path=foo/bar.py` query param to filter
          the diff to just that one file diff

        #### Response


        The raw diff is returned as-is, in whatever encoding the files in the

        repository use. It is not decoded into unicode. As such, the

        content-type is `text/plain`.

        Returns a paginated list of commits that modified the specified file.


        Commits are returned in reverse chronological order. This is roughly

        equivalent to the following commands:

            $ git log --follow --date-order <sha> <path>

        By default, Bitbucket will follow renames and the path name in the

        returned entries reflects that. This can be turned off using the

        `?renames=false` query parameter.


        Results are returned in descending chronological order by default, and

        like most endpoints you can

        [filter and sort](/cloud/bitbucket/rest/intro/#filtering) the response
        to

        only provide exactly the data you want.


        The example response returns commits made before 2011-05-18 against a
        file

        named `README.rst`. The results are filtered to only return the path and

        date. This request can be made using:


        ```

        $ curl
        'https://api.bitbucket.org/2.0/repositories/evzijst/dogslow/filehistory/master/README.rst'\
          '?fields=values.next,values.path,values.commit.date&q=commit.date<=2011-05-18'
        ```


        In the response you can see that the file was renamed to `README.rst`

        by the commit made on 2011-05-16, and was previously named `README.txt`.

      description: >-
        Creates a new fork of the specified repository.


        #### Forking a repository


        To create a fork, specify the workspace explicitly as part of the

        request body:


        ```

        $ curl -X POST -u jdoe
        https://api.bitbucket.org/2.0/repositories/atlassian/bbql/forks \
          -H 'Content-Type: application/json' -d '{
            "name": "bbql_fork",
            "workspace": {
              "slug": "atlassian"
            }
        }'

        ```


        To fork a repository into the same workspace, also specify a new `name`.


        When you specify a value for `name`, it will also affect the `slug`.

        The `slug` is reflected in the repository URL of the new fork. It is

        derived from `name` by substituting non-ASCII characters, removes

        whitespace, and changes characters to lower case. For example,

        `My repo` would turn into `my_repo`.


        You need contributor access to create new forks within a workspace.



        #### Change the properties of a new fork


        By default the fork inherits most of its properties from the parent.

        However, since the optional POST body document follows the normal

        `repository` JSON schema and you can override the new fork's

        properties.


        Properties that can be overridden include:


        * description

        * fork_policy

        * language

        * mainbranch

        * is_private (note that a private repo's fork_policy might prohibit
          the creation of public forks, in which `is_private=False` would fail)
        * has_issues (to initialize or disable the new repo's issue tracker --
          note that the actual contents of the parent repository's issue
          tracker are not copied during forking)
        * has_wiki (to initialize or disable the new repo's wiki --
          note that the actual contents of the parent repository's wiki are not
          copied during forking)
        * project (when forking into a private project, the fork's `is_private`
          must be `true`)

        Properties that cannot be modified include:


        * scm

        * parent

        * full_name

          https://api.bitbucket.org/2.0/repositories/my-workspace/my-repo-slug/hooks

                "issue:updated"
              ]
            }'
        ```


        When the `secret` is provided it will be used as the key to generate a
        HMAC

        digest value sent in the `X-Hub-Signature` header at delivery time.
        Passing

        a `null` or empty `secret` or not passing a `secret` will leave the
        webhook's

        secret unset. Bitbucket only generates the `X-Hub-Signature` when the
        webhook's

        secret is set.


        Note that this call requires the webhook scope, as well as any scope

        that applies to the events that the webhook subscribes to. In the

        example above that means: `webhook`, `repository` and `issue`.


        Also note that the `url` must properly resolve and cannot be an

        internal, non-routed address.

        * `description`

        * `url`

        * `secret`

        * `active`

        * `events`


        The hook's secret is used as a key to generate the HMAC hex digest sent
        in the

        `X-Hub-Signature` header at delivery time. This signature is only
        generated

        when the hook has a secret.


        Set the hook's secret by passing the new value in the `secret` field.
        Passing a

        `null` value in the `secret` field will remove the secret from the hook.
        The

        hook's secret can be left unchanged by not passing the `secret` field in
        the

        change record is created under the `/issues/123/changes` endpoint. It

        also has a comment associated with the change.


        Note that this operation is changing significantly, due to privacy
        changes.

        See the
        [announcement](https://developer.atlassian.com/cloud/bitbucket/bitbucket-api-changes-gdpr/#changes-to-the-issue-changes-api)

        for details.


        Changes support [filtering and
        sorting](/cloud/bitbucket/rest/intro/#filtering) that

        can be used to search for specific changes. For instance, to see

        when an issue transitioned to "resolved":


        ```

        $ curl -s
        https://api.bitbucket.org/2.0/repositories/site/master/issues/1/changes
        \
           -G --data-urlencode='q=changes.state.new = "resolved"'
        ```


        This resource is only available on repositories that have the issue

        tracker enabled.


        N.B.


        The `changes.assignee` and `changes.assignee_account_id` fields are not

        a `user` object. Instead, they contain the raw `username` and

        `account_id` of the user. This is to protect the integrity of the audit

        log even after a user account gets deleted.


        The `changes.assignee` field is deprecated will disappear in the

        future. Use `changes.assignee_account_id` instead.

        - Issue tracker
      description: |-
        Makes a change to the specified issue.

        For example, to change an issue's state and assignee, create a new
        change object that modifies these fields:

        ```
        curl https://api.bitbucket.org/2.0/site/master/issues/1234/changes \
          -s -u evzijst -X POST -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
          -d '{
            "changes": {
              "assignee_account_id": {
                "new": "557058:c0b72ad0-1cb5-4018-9cdc-0cde8492c443"
              },
              "state": {
                "new": 'resolved"
              }
            }
            "message": {
              "raw": "This is now resolved."
            }
          }'
        ```

        The above example also includes a custom comment to go alongside the
        change. This comment will also be visible on the issue page in the UI.

        The fields of the `changes` object are strings, not objects. This
        allows for immutable change log records, even after user accounts,
        milestones, or other objects recorded in a change entry, get renamed or
        deleted.

        The `assignee_account_id` field stores the account id. When POSTing a
        new change and changing the assignee, the client should therefore use
        the user's account_id in the `changes.assignee_account_id.new` field.

        This call requires authentication. Private repositories or private
        issue trackers require the caller to authenticate with an account that
        has appropriate authorization.

        Endpoint to create and initiate a pipeline.

        There are a couple of different options to initiate a pipeline, where
        the payload of the request will determine which type of pipeline will be
        instantiated.

        # Trigger a Pipeline for a branch

        One way to trigger pipelines is by specifying the branch for which you
        want to trigger a pipeline.

        The specified branch will be used to determine which pipeline definition
        from the `bitbucket-pipelines.yml` file will be applied to initiate the
        pipeline. The pipeline will then do a clone of the repository and
        checkout the latest revision of the specified branch.


        ### Example


        ```

        $ curl -X POST -is -u username:password \
          -H 'Content-Type: application/json' \
         https://api.bitbucket.org/2.0/repositories/jeroendr/meat-demo2/pipelines/ \
          -d '
          {
            "target": {
              "ref_type": "branch",
              "type": "pipeline_ref_target",
              "ref_name": "master"
            }
          }'
        ```

        # Trigger a Pipeline for a commit on a branch or tag

        You can initiate a pipeline for a specific commit and in the context of
        a specified reference (e.g. a branch, tag or bookmark).

        The specified reference will be used to determine which pipeline
        definition from the bitbucket-pipelines.yml file will be applied to
        initiate the pipeline. The pipeline will clone the repository and then
        do a checkout the specified reference.


        The following reference types are supported:


        * `branch`

        * `named_branch`

        * `bookmark`
         * `tag`

        ### Example


        ```

        $ curl -X POST -is -u username:password \
          -H 'Content-Type: application/json' \
          https://api.bitbucket.org/2.0/repositories/jeroendr/meat-demo2/pipelines/ \
          -d '
          {
            "target": {
              "commit": {
                "type": "commit",
                "hash": "ce5b7431602f7cbba007062eeb55225c6e18e956"
              },
              "ref_type": "branch",
              "type": "pipeline_ref_target",
              "ref_name": "master"
            }
          }'
        ```

        # Trigger a specific pipeline definition for a commit

        You can trigger a specific pipeline that is defined in your
        `bitbucket-pipelines.yml` file for a specific commit.

        In addition to the commit revision, you specify the type and pattern of
        the selector that identifies the pipeline definition. The resulting
        pipeline will then clone the repository and checkout the specified
        revision.


        ### Example


        ```

        $ curl -X POST -is -u username:password \
          -H 'Content-Type: application/json' \
         https://api.bitbucket.org/2.0/repositories/jeroendr/meat-demo2/pipelines/ \
         -d '
          {
             "target": {
              "commit": {
                 "hash":"a3c4e02c9a3755eccdc3764e6ea13facdf30f923",
                 "type":"commit"
               },
                "selector": {
                   "type":"custom",
                      "pattern":"Deploy to production"
                  },
                "type":"pipeline_commit_target"
           }
          }'
        ```

        # Trigger a specific pipeline definition for a commit on a branch or tag

        You can trigger a specific pipeline that is defined in your
        `bitbucket-pipelines.yml` file for a specific commit in the context of a
        specified reference.

        In addition to the commit revision, you specify the type and pattern of
        the selector that identifies the pipeline definition, as well as the
        reference information. The resulting pipeline will then clone the
        repository a checkout the specified reference.


        ### Example


        ```

        $ curl -X POST -is -u username:password \
          -H 'Content-Type: application/json' \
         https://api.bitbucket.org/2.0/repositories/jeroendr/meat-demo2/pipelines/ \
         -d '
          {
             "target": {
              "commit": {
                 "hash":"a3c4e02c9a3755eccdc3764e6ea13facdf30f923",
                 "type":"commit"
               },
               "selector": {
                  "type": "custom",
                  "pattern": "Deploy to production"
               },
               "type": "pipeline_ref_target",
               "ref_name": "master",
               "ref_type": "branch"
             }
          }'
        ```



        # Trigger a custom pipeline with variables

        In addition to triggering a custom pipeline that is defined in your
        `bitbucket-pipelines.yml` file as shown in the examples above, you can
        specify variables that will be available for your build. In the request,
        provide a list of variables, specifying the following for each variable:
        key, value, and whether it should be secured or not (this field is
        optional and defaults to not secured).


        ### Example


        ```

        $ curl -X POST -is -u username:password \
          -H 'Content-Type: application/json' \
         https://api.bitbucket.org/2.0/repositories/{workspace}/{repo_slug}/pipelines/ \
         -d '
          {
            "target": {
              "type": "pipeline_ref_target",
              "ref_type": "branch",
              "ref_name": "master",
              "selector": {
                "type": "custom",
                "pattern": "Deploy to production"
              }
            },
            "variables": [
              {
                "key": "var1key",
                "value": "var1value",
                "secured": true
              },
              {
                "key": "var2key",
                "value": "var2value"
              }
            ]
          }'
        ```


        # Trigger a pull request pipeline


        You can also initiate a pipeline for a specific pull request.


        ### Example


        ```

        $ curl -X POST -is -u username:password \
          -H 'Content-Type: application/json' \

        By default only open pull requests are returned. This can be controlled

        using the `state` query parameter. To retrieve pull requests that are

        in one of multiple states, repeat the `state` parameter for each

        individual state.


        This endpoint also supports filtering and sorting of the results. See

      description: >-
        Creates a new pull request where the destination repository is

        this repository and the author is the authenticated user.


        The minimum required fields to create a pull request are `title` and

        `source`, specified by a branch name.


        ```

        curl
        https://api.bitbucket.org/2.0/repositories/my-workspace/my-repository/pullrequests
        \
            -u my-username:my-password \
            --request POST \
            --header 'Content-Type: application/json' \
            --data '{
                "title": "My Title",
                "source": {
                    "branch": {
                        "name": "staging"
                    }
                }
            }'
        ```


        If the pull request's `destination` is not specified, it will default

        to the `repository.mainbranch`. To open a pull request to a

        different branch, say from a feature branch to a staging branch,

        specify a `destination` (same format as the `source`):


        ```

        {
            "title": "My Title",
            "source": {
                "branch": {
                    "name": "my-feature-branch"
                }
            },
            "destination": {
                "branch": {
                    "name": "staging"
                }
            }
        }

        ```


        Reviewers can be specified by adding an array of user objects as the

        `reviewers` property.


        ```

        {
            "title": "My Title",
            "source": {
                "branch": {
                    "name": "my-feature-branch"
                }
            },

        This handler serves both a v20 and internal endpoint. The v20 endpoint

        returns reviewer comments, updates, approvals and request changes. The
        internal

        endpoint includes those plus tasks and attachments.


        Comments created on a file or a line of code have an inline property.

        This handler serves both a v20 and internal endpoint. The v20 endpoint

        returns reviewer comments, updates, approvals and request changes. The
        internal

        endpoint includes those plus tasks and attachments.


        Comments created on a file or a line of code have an inline property.

        When merging a pull request takes too long, the client receives a

        task ID along with a 202 status code. The task ID can be used in a call

        to this endpoint to check the status of a merge task.


        ```

        curl -X GET
        https://api.bitbucket.org/2.0/repositories/atlassian/bitbucket/pullrequests/2286/merge/task-status/<task_id>

        ```


        If the merge task is not yet finished, a PENDING status will be
        returned.


        ```

        HTTP/2 200

        {

                }
            }
        }

        ```


        If the merge was successful, a SUCCESS status will be returned.

        By default, results will be in the order the underlying source control
        system returns them and identical to

        the ordering one sees when running "$ git show-ref". Note that this
        follows simple

        lexical ordering of the ref names.


        This can be undesirable as it does apply any natural sorting semantics,
        meaning for instance that refs are

        sorted ["branch1", "branch10", "branch2", "v10", "v11", "v9"] instead of
        ["branch1", "branch2",

        Sorting can be changed using the ?sort= query parameter. When using
        ?sort=name to explicitly sort on ref name,

        Bitbucket will apply natural sorting and interpret numerical values as
        numbers instead of strings.

        This is equivalent to directly hitting

        [/2.0/repositories/{username}/{repo_slug}/src/{commit}/{path}](src/%7Bcommit%7D/%7Bpath%7D)

        without having to know the name or SHA1 of the repo's main branch.

      description: >-
        This endpoint is used to create new commits in the repository by

        uploading files.


        To add a new file to a repository:


        ```

        $ curl https://api.bitbucket.org/2.0/repositories/username/slug/src \
          -F /repo/path/to/image.png=@image.png
        ```


        This will create a new commit on top of the main branch, inheriting the

        contents of the main branch, but adding (or overwriting) the

        `image.png` file to the repository in the `/repo/path/to` directory.


        To create a commit that deletes files, use the `files` parameter:


        ```

        $ curl https://api.bitbucket.org/2.0/repositories/username/slug/src \
          -F files=/file/to/delete/1.txt \
          -F files=/file/to/delete/2.txt
        ```


        You can add/modify/delete multiple files in a request. Rename/move a

        file by deleting the old path and adding the content at the new path.


        This endpoint accepts `multipart/form-data` (as in the examples above),

        as well as `application/x-www-form-urlencoded`.


        Note: `multipart/form-data` is currently not supported by Forge apps

        for this API.


        #### multipart/form-data


        A `multipart/form-data` post contains a series of "form fields" that

        identify both the individual files that are being uploaded, as well as

        additional, optional meta data.


        Files are uploaded in file form fields (those that have a

        `Content-Disposition` parameter) whose field names point to the remote

        path in the repository where the file should be stored. Path field

        names are always interpreted to be absolute from the root of the

        repository, regardless whether the client uses a leading slash (as the

        above `curl` example did).


        File contents are treated as bytes and are not decoded as text.


        The commit message, as well as other non-file meta data for the

        request, is sent along as normal form field elements. Meta data fields

        share the same namespace as the file objects. For `multipart/form-data`

        bodies that should not lead to any ambiguity, as the

        `Content-Disposition` header will contain the `filename` parameter to

        distinguish between a file named "message" and the commit message field.


        #### application/x-www-form-urlencoded


        It is also possible to upload new files using a simple

        `application/x-www-form-urlencoded` POST. This can be convenient when

        uploading pure text files:


        ```

        $ curl https://api.bitbucket.org/2.0/repositories/atlassian/bbql/src \
          --data-urlencode "/path/to/me.txt=Lorem ipsum." \
          --data-urlencode "message=Initial commit" \
          --data-urlencode "author=Erik van Zijst <erik.van.zijst@gmail.com>"
        ```


        There could be a field name clash if a client were to upload a file

        named "message", as this filename clashes with the meta data property

        for the commit message. To avoid this and to upload files whose names

        clash with the meta data properties, use a leading slash for the files,

        e.g. `curl --data-urlencode "/message=file contents"`.


        When an explicit slash is omitted for a file whose path matches that of

        a meta data parameter, then it is interpreted as meta data, not as a

        file.


        #### Executables and links


        While this API aims to facilitate the most common use cases, it is

        possible to perform some more advanced operations like creating a new

        symlink in the repository, or creating an executable file.


        Files can be supplied with a `x-attributes` value in the

        `Content-Disposition` header. For example, to upload an executable

        file, as well as create a symlink from `README.txt` to `README`:


        ```

        --===============1438169132528273974==

        Content-Type: text/plain; charset="us-ascii"

        MIME-Version: 1.0

        Content-Transfer-Encoding: 7bit

        Content-ID: "bin/shutdown.sh"

        Content-Disposition: attachment; filename="shutdown.sh";
        x-attributes:"executable"


        #!/bin/sh

        halt


        --===============1438169132528273974==

        Content-Type: text/plain; charset="us-ascii"

        MIME-Version: 1.0

        Content-Transfer-Encoding: 7bit

        Content-ID: "/README.txt"

        Content-Disposition: attachment; filename="README.txt";
        x-attributes:"link"


        README

        --===============1438169132528273974==--

        ```


        Links are files that contain the target path and have

        `x-attributes:"link"` set.


        When overwriting links with files, or vice versa, the newly uploaded

        file determines both the new contents, as well as the attributes. That

        means uploading a file without specifying `x-attributes="link"` will

        create a regular file, even if the parent commit hosted a symlink at

        the same path.


        The same applies to executables. When modifying an existing executable

        file, the form-data file element must include

        `x-attributes="executable"` in order to preserve the executable status

        of the file.


        Note that this API does not support the creation or manipulation of

        subrepos / submodules.

        This endpoints is used to retrieve the contents of a single file,

        or the contents of a directory at a specified revision.


        #### Raw file contents


        When `path` points to a file, this endpoint returns the raw contents.

        The response's Content-Type is derived from the filename

        extension (not from the contents). The file contents are not processed

        and no character encoding/recoding is performed and as a result no

        character encoding is included as part of the Content-Type.


        The `Content-Disposition` header will be "attachment" to prevent

        browsers from running executable files.


        If the file is managed by LFS, then a 301 redirect pointing to

        Atlassian's media services platform is returned.


        The response includes an ETag that is based on the contents of the file

        and its attributes. This means that an empty `__init__.py` always

        returns the same ETag, regardless on the directory it lives in, or the

        commit it is on.


        #### File meta data


        When the request for a file path includes the query parameter

        `?format=meta`, instead of returning the file's raw contents, Bitbucket

        instead returns the JSON object describing the file's properties:


        ```javascript

        $ curl
        https://api.bitbucket.org/2.0/repositories/atlassian/bbql/src/eefd5ef/tests/__init__.py?format=meta

        {
          "links": {
            "self": {
              "href": "https://api.bitbucket.org/2.0/repositories/atlassian/bbql/src/eefd5ef5d3df01aed629f650959d6706d54cd335/tests/__init__.py"
            },
            "meta": {
              "href": "https://api.bitbucket.org/2.0/repositories/atlassian/bbql/src/eefd5ef5d3df01aed629f650959d6706d54cd335/tests/__init__.py?format=meta"
            }
          },
          "path": "tests/__init__.py",
          "commit": {
            "type": "commit",
            "hash": "eefd5ef5d3df01aed629f650959d6706d54cd335",
            "links": {
              "self": {
                "href": "https://api.bitbucket.org/2.0/repositories/atlassian/bbql/commit/eefd5ef5d3df01aed629f650959d6706d54cd335"
              },
              "html": {
                "href": "https://bitbucket.org/atlassian/bbql/commits/eefd5ef5d3df01aed629f650959d6706d54cd335"
              }
            }
          },
          "attributes": [],
          "type": "commit_file",
          "size": 0
        }

        ```


        File objects contain an `attributes` element that contains a list of

        possible modifiers. Currently defined values are:


        * `link` -- indicates that the entry is a symbolic link. The contents
            of the file represent the path the link points to.
        * `executable` -- indicates that the file has the executable bit set.

        * `subrepository` -- indicates that the entry points to a submodule or
            subrepo. The contents of the file is the SHA1 of the repository
            pointed to.
        * `binary` -- indicates whether Bitbucket thinks the file is binary.


        This endpoint can provide an alternative to how a HEAD request can be

        used to check for the existence of a file, or a file's size without

        incurring the overhead of receiving its full contents.



        #### Directory listings


        When `path` points to a directory instead of a file, the response is a

        paginated list of directory and file objects in the same order as the

        underlying SCM system would return them.


        For example:


        ```javascript

        $ curl
        https://api.bitbucket.org/2.0/repositories/atlassian/bbql/src/eefd5ef/tests

        {
          "pagelen": 10,
          "values": [
            {
              "path": "tests/test_project",

              "links": {
                "self": {
                  "href": "https://api.bitbucket.org/2.0/repositories/atlassian/bbql/src/eefd5ef5d3df01aed629f650959d6706d54cd335/tests/test_project/"

                }
              },
              "commit": {
                "type": "commit",
                "hash": "eefd5ef5d3df01aed629f650959d6706d54cd335",
                "links": {

                    "href": "https://api.bitbucket.org/2.0/repositories/atlassian/bbql/commit/eefd5ef5d3df01aed629f650959d6706d54cd335"

                }
              },
              "path": "tests/__init__.py",
              "commit": {
                "type": "commit",
                "hash": "eefd5ef5d3df01aed629f650959d6706d54cd335",
                "links": {
                  "self": {
                    "href": "https://api.bitbucket.org/2.0/repositories/atlassian/bbql/commit/eefd5ef5d3df01aed629f650959d6706d54cd335"
                  },
                  "html": {
                    "href": "https://bitbucket.org/atlassian/bbql/commits/eefd5ef5d3df01aed629f650959d6706d54cd335"
                  }
                }
              },
              "attributes": [],
              "type": "commit_file",
              "size": 0
            }
          ],
          "page": 1,
          "size": 2
        }

        ```


        When listing the contents of the repo's root directory, the use of a

        trailing slash at the end of the URL is required.


        The response by default is not recursive, meaning that only the direct
        contents of

        a path are returned. The response does not recurse down into

        subdirectories. In order to "walk" the entire directory tree, the

        client can either parse each response and follow the `self` links of
        each

        `commit_directory` object, or can specify a `max_depth` to recurse to.


        The max_depth parameter will do a breadth-first search to return the
        contents of the subdirectories

        up to the depth specified. Breadth-first search was chosen as it leads
        to the least amount of

        file system operations for git. If the `max_depth` parameter is
        specified to be too

        large, the call will time out and return a 555.


        Each returned object is either a `commit_file`, or a `commit_directory`,

        both of which contain a `path` element. This path is the absolute path

        from the root of the repository. Each object also contains a `commit`

        object which embeds the commit the file is on. Note that this is merely

        the commit that was used in the URL. It is *not* the commit that last

        modified the file.


        Directory objects have 2 representations. Their `self` link returns the

        paginated contents of the directory. The `meta` link on the other hand

        returns the actual `directory` object itself, e.g.:


        ```javascript

        {
          "path": "tests/test_project",
          "type": "commit_directory",
          "links": {
            "self": {
              "href": "https://api.bitbucket.org/2.0/repositories/atlassian/bbql/src/eefd5ef5d3df01aed629f650959d6706d54cd335/tests/test_project/"
            },
            "meta": {
              "href": "https://api.bitbucket.org/2.0/repositories/atlassian/bbql/src/eefd5ef5d3df01aed629f650959d6706d54cd335/tests/test_project/?format=meta"
            }
          },
          "commit": { ... }
        }

        ```


        #### Querying, filtering and sorting


        Like most API endpoints, this API supports the Bitbucket

        querying/filtering syntax and so you could filter a directory listing

        to only include entries that match certain criteria. For instance, to

        list all binary files over 1kb use the expression:


        `size > 1024 and attributes = "binary"`


        which after urlencoding yields the query string:


        `?q=size%3E1024+and+attributes%3D%22binary%22`


        To change the ordering of the response, use the `?sort` parameter:


        `.../src/eefd5ef/?sort=-size`


        See [filtering and sorting](/cloud/bitbucket/rest/intro/#filtering) for
        more

        details.

        Returns all snippets. Like pull requests, repositories and workspaces,
        the

        full set of snippets is defined by what the current user has access to.


        This includes all snippets owned by any of the workspaces the user is a
        member of,

        or snippets by other users that the current user is either watching or
        has collaborated

        on (for instance by commenting on it).


        To limit the set of returned snippets, apply the

        `?role=[owner|contributor|member]` query parameter where the roles are

        defined as follows:


        * `owner`: all snippets owned by the current user

        * `contributor`: all snippets owned by, or watched by the current user

        * `member`: created in a workspaces or watched by the current user


        When no role is specified, all public snippets are returned, as well as
        all

        privately owned snippets watched or commented on.


        The returned response is a normal paginated JSON list. This endpoint

        only supports `application/json` responses and no

        `multipart/form-data` or `multipart/related`. As a result, it is not

        possible to include the file contents.

      description: >-
        Creates a new snippet under the authenticated user's account.


        Snippets can contain multiple files. Both text and binary files are

        supported.


        The simplest way to create a new snippet from a local file:

            $ curl -u username:password -X POST https://api.bitbucket.org/2.0/snippets               -F file=@image.png

        Creating snippets through curl has a few limitations and so let's look

        at a more complicated scenario.


        Snippets are created with a multipart POST. Both `multipart/form-data`

        and `multipart/related` are supported. Both allow the creation of

        snippets with both meta data (title, etc), as well as multiple text

        and binary files.


        The main difference is that `multipart/related` can use rich encoding

        for the meta data (currently JSON).



        multipart/related (RFC-2387)

        ----------------------------


        This is the most advanced and efficient way to create a paste.

        The request contains multiple parts and is structured as follows.


        The first part is the JSON document that describes the snippet's

        properties or meta data. It either has to be the first part, or the

        request's `Content-Type` header must contain the `start` parameter to

        point to it.


        The remaining parts are the files of which there can be zero or more.

        Each file part should contain the `Content-ID` MIME header through

        which the JSON meta data's `files` element addresses it. The value

        should be the name of the file.


        `Content-Disposition` is an optional MIME header. The header's

        optional `filename` parameter can be used to specify the file name

        that Bitbucket should use when writing the file to disk. When present,

        `filename` takes precedence over the value of `Content-ID`.


        When the JSON body omits the `files` element, the remaining parts are

        not ignored. Instead, each file is added to the new snippet as if its

        name was explicitly linked (the use of the `files` elements is

        mandatory for some operations like deleting or renaming files).



        multipart/form-data

        -------------------


        The use of JSON for the snippet's meta data is optional. Meta data can

        also be supplied as regular form fields in a more conventional

        `multipart/form-data` request:

            $ curl -X POST -u credentials https://api.bitbucket.org/2.0/snippets               -F title="My snippet"               -F file=@foo.txt -F file=@image.png

            POST /2.0/snippets HTTP/1.1
            Content-Length: 951
            Content-Type: multipart/form-data; boundary=----------------------------63a4b224c59f

            ------------------------------63a4b224c59f
            Content-Disposition: form-data; name="file"; filename="foo.txt"
            Content-Type: text/plain

            foo

            ------------------------------63a4b224c59f
            Content-Disposition: form-data; name="file"; filename="image.png"
            Content-Type: application/octet-stream

            ?PNG

            IHDR?1??I.....
            ------------------------------63a4b224c59f
            Content-Disposition: form-data; name="title"

            My snippet
            ------------------------------63a4b224c59f--

        Here the meta data properties are included as flat, top-level form

        fields. The file attachments use the `file` field name. To attach

        multiple files, simply repeat the field.


        The advantage of `multipart/form-data` over `multipart/related` is

        that it can be easier to build clients.


        Essentially all properties are optional, `title` and `files` included.



        Sharing and Visibility

        ----------------------


        Snippets can be either public (visible to anyone on Bitbucket, as well

        as anonymous users), or private (visible only to members of the
        workspace).

        This is controlled through the snippet's `is_private` element:


        * **is_private=false** -- everyone, including anonymous users can view
          the snippet
        * **is_private=true** -- only workspace members can view the snippet


        To create the snippet under a workspace, just append the workspace ID

        to the URL. See
        [`/2.0/snippets/{workspace}`](/cloud/bitbucket/rest/api-group-snippets/#api-snippets-workspace-post).

        Retrieves a single snippet.

        Snippets support multiple content types:

        * application/json
        * multipart/related
        * multipart/form-data


        application/json
        ----------------

        The default content type of the response is `application/json`.
        Since JSON is always `utf-8`, it cannot reliably contain file contents
        for files that are not text. Therefore, JSON snippet documents only
        contain the filename and links to the file contents.

        This means that in order to retrieve all parts of a snippet, N+1
        requests need to be made (where N is the number of files in the
        snippet).


        multipart/related
        -----------------

        To retrieve an entire snippet in a single response, use the
        `Accept: multipart/related` HTTP request header.

            $ curl -H "Accept: multipart/related" https://api.bitbucket.org/2.0/snippets/evzijst/1

        multipart/form-data
        -------------------

        As with creating new snippets, `multipart/form-data` can be used as an
        alternative to `multipart/related`. However, the inherently flat
        structure of form-data means that only basic, root-level properties
        can be returned, while nested elements like `links` are omitted:

            $ curl -H "Accept: multipart/form-data" https://api.bitbucket.org/2.0/snippets/evzijst/kypj

        - Snippets
      description: |-
        Used to update a snippet. Use this to add and delete files and to
        change a snippet's title.

        To update a snippet, one can either PUT a full snapshot, or only the
        parts that need to be changed.

        The contract for PUT on this API is that properties missing from the
        request remain untouched so that snippets can be efficiently
        manipulated with differential payloads.

        To delete a property (e.g. the title, or a file), include its name in
        the request, but omit its value (use `null`).

        As in Git, explicit renaming of files is not supported. Instead, to
        rename a file, delete it and add it again under another name. This can
        be done atomically in a single request. Rename detection is left to
        the SCM.

        PUT supports three different content types for both request and
        response bodies:

        * `application/json`
        * `multipart/related`
        * `multipart/form-data`

        The content type used for the request body can be different than that
        used for the response. Content types are specified using standard HTTP
        headers.

        Use the `Content-Type` and `Accept` headers to select the desired
        request and response format.


        application/json
        ----------------

        As with creation and retrieval, the content type determines what
        properties can be manipulated. `application/json` does not support
        file contents and is therefore limited to a snippet's meta data.

        To update the title, without changing any of its files:

            $ curl -X POST -H "Content-Type: application/json" https://api.bitbucket.org/2.0/snippets/evzijst/kypj             -d '{"title": "Updated title"}'


        To delete the title:

            $ curl -X POST -H "Content-Type: application/json" https://api.bitbucket.org/2.0/snippets/evzijst/kypj             -d '{"title": null}'

        Not all parts of a snippet can be manipulated. The owner and creator
        for instance are immutable.


        multipart/related
        -----------------

        `multipart/related` can be used to manipulate all of a snippet's
        properties. The body is identical to a POST. properties omitted from
        the request are left unchanged. Since the `start` part contains JSON,
        the mechanism for manipulating the snippet's meta data is identical
        to `application/json` requests.

        To update one of a snippet's file contents, while also changing its
        title:

            PUT /2.0/snippets/evzijst/kypj HTTP/1.1

              "files": {
                  "foo.txt": {}
                }
            }

            Updated file contents.

            --===============1438169132528273974==--

        Here only the parts that are changed are included in the body. The
        other files remain untouched.

        Note the use of the `files` list in the JSON part. This list contains
        the files that are being manipulated. This list should have
        corresponding multiparts in the request that contain the new contents
        of these files.

        If a filename in the `files` list does not have a corresponding part,
        it will be deleted from the snippet, as shown below:

        multipart/form-data
        -----------------

        Again, one can also use `multipart/form-data` to manipulate file
        contents and meta data atomically.

            $ curl -X PUT http://localhost:12345/2.0/snippets/evzijst/kypj             -F title="My updated snippet" -F file=@foo.txt

            ------------------------------63a4b224c59f

        To delete a file, omit its contents while including its name in the
        `files` field:

            $ curl -X PUT https://api.bitbucket.org/2.0/snippets/evzijst/kypj -F files=image.png

            PUT /2.0/snippets/evzijst/kypj HTTP/1.1

        The explicit use of the `files` element in `multipart/related` and
        `multipart/form-data` is only required when deleting files.
        The default mode of operation is for file parts to be processed,
        regardless of whether or not they are listed in `files`, as a
        convenience to the client.

        Note that this only works for versioned URLs that point to the latest
        commit of the snippet. Pointing to an older commit results in a 405
        status code.

        To delete a snippet, regardless of whether or not concurrent changes
        are being made to it, use `DELETE /snippets/{encoded_id}` instead.

        Identical to `GET /snippets/encoded_id`, except that this endpoint
        can be used to retrieve the contents of the snippet as it was at an
        older revision, while `/snippets/encoded_id` always returns the
        snippet's current revision.

        Note that only the snippet's file contents are versioned, not its
        meta data properties like the title.

        Other than that, the two endpoints are identical in behavior.

        Identical to `UPDATE /snippets/encoded_id`, except that this endpoint

        (most recent) version can be updated and requests on all other,
        older revisions fail by returning a 405 status.

        Usage of this endpoint over the unrestricted `/snippets/encoded_id`
        could be desired if the caller wants to be sure no concurrent
        modifications have taken place between the moment of the UPDATE
        request and the original GET.

        This can be considered a so-called "Compare And Swap", or CAS
        operation.

        Note that this resource is different in functionality from the `patch`

        * patches have a commit header with the username, message, etc

          diff to just that one file diff (not supported for patches)
        * for a merge, the diff will show the diff between the merge commit and
          its first parent (identical to how PRs work), while patch returns a
          response containing separate patches for each commit on the second
          parent's ancestry, up to the oldest common ancestor (identical to
          its reachability).

        Note that the character encoding of the contents of the diff is
        unspecified as Git does not track this, making it hard for
        Bitbucket to reliably determine this.

        Note that searches can match in the file's text (`content_matches`),
        the path (`path_matches`), or both.

        You can use the same syntax for the search query as in the UI.
        E.g. to search for "foo" only within the repository "demo",
        use the query parameter `search_query=foo+repo:demo`.

        Similar to other APIs, you can request more fields using a
        `fields` query parameter. E.g. to get some more information about
        the repository of matched files, use the query parameter
        `search_query=foo&fields=%2Bvalues.file.commit.repository`
        (the `%2B` is a URL-encoded `+`).

        Search for code in the repositories of the specified user.

        Note that searches can match in the file's text (`content_matches`),
        the path (`path_matches`), or both.

        You can use the same syntax for the search query as in the UI.
        E.g. to search for "foo" only within the repository "demo",
        use the query parameter `search_query=foo+repo:demo`.

        Similar to other APIs, you can request more fields using a
        `fields` query parameter. E.g. to get some more information about
        the repository of matched files, use the query parameter
        `search_query=foo&fields=%2Bvalues.file.commit.repository`
        (the `%2B` is a URL-encoded `+`).

        Creates a new webhook on the specified workspace.


        Workspace webhooks are fired for events from all repositories contained

        by that workspace.


        Example:


        ```

        $ curl -X POST -u credentials -H 'Content-Type: application/json'
          https://api.bitbucket.org/2.0/workspaces/my-workspace/hooks
          -d '
            {
              "description": "Webhook Description",
              "url": "https://example.com/",
              "active": true,
              "secret": "this is a really bad secret",
              "events": [
                "repo:push",
                "issue:created",
                "issue:updated"
              ]
            }'
        ```


        When the `secret` is provided it will be used as the key to generate a
        HMAC

        digest value sent in the `X-Hub-Signature` header at delivery time.
        Passing

        a `null` or empty `secret` or not passing a `secret` will leave the
        webhook's

        secret unset. Bitbucket only generates the `X-Hub-Signature` when the
        webhook's

        secret is set.


        This call requires the webhook scope, as well as any scope

        that applies to the events that the webhook subscribes to. In the

        example above that means: `webhook`, `repository` and `issue`.


        The `url` must properly resolve and cannot be an internal, non-routed
        address.


        Only workspace owners can install webhooks on workspaces.

        * `url`

        * `secret`

        * `active`

        * `events`


        The hook's secret is used as a key to generate the HMAC hex digest sent
        in the

        `X-Hub-Signature` header at delivery time. This signature is only
        generated

        when the hook has a secret.


        Set the hook's secret by passing the new value in the `secret` field.
        Passing a

        `null` value in the `secret` field will remove the secret from the hook.
        The

        hook's secret can be left unchanged by not passing the `secret` field in
        the

        request.

        #### Creation

        See the POST documentation for the project collection for an
        example of the request body.

        Note: The `key` should not be specified in the body of request
        (since it is already present in the URL). The `name` is required,
        everything else is optional.

        See the POST documentation for the project collection for an

        Note: The key is not required in the body (since it is already in
        the URL). The key may be specified in the body, if the intent is
        to change the key itself. In such a scenario, the location of the

        `production` property will leave the production branch unchanged.


        The `branch_types` property contains the branch types to be updated.

        Only the branch types passed will be updated. All updates will be

        rejected if it would leave the branching model in an invalid state.

        For branch types this means that:


        1. The prefixes for all enabled branch types are valid. For example,
           it is not possible to use '*' inside a Git prefix.
        2. A prefix of an enabled branch type must not be a prefix of another
           enabled branch type. This is to ensure that a branch can be easily
           classified by its prefix unambiguously.

        It is possible to store an invalid prefix if that branch type would be

        left disabled. Only the passed properties will be updated. The

        properties not passed will be left unchanged. Each branch type must

        have a `kind` property to identify it.

      summary: Search for code in a workspace
      description: |
        Search for code in the repositories of the specified workspace.

        Note that searches can match in the file's text (`content_matches`),
        the path (`path_matches`), or both.

        You can use the same syntax for the search query as in the UI.
        E.g. to search for "foo" only within the repository "demo",
        use the query parameter `search_query=foo+repo:demo`.

        Similar to other APIs, you can request more fields using a
        `fields` query parameter. E.g. to get some more information about
        the repository of matched files, use the query parameter
        `search_query=foo&fields=%2Bvalues.file.commit.repository`
        (the `%2B` is a URL-encoded `+`).

        Try `fields=%2Bvalues.*.*.*.*` to get an idea what's possible.

  - name: Addon
    description: |
      The addon resource is intended to use used by Bitbucket Cloud Connect
      Apps, and only supports JWT authentication.
  - name: Branch restrictions
    description: |
      Repository owners and administrators can set branch management
      rules on a repository that control what can be pushed by whom.
      Through these rules, you can enforce a project or team
      workflow. For example, owners or administrators can:

      * Limit push powers
      * Prevent branch deletion
      * Prevent history re-writes (Git only)
  - name: Branching model
    description: |
      The branching model resource is used to modify the branching model
      for a repository.

      You can use the branching model to define a branch based workflow
      for your repositories. When you map your workflow to branch types,
      you can ensure that branches are named consistently by configuring
      which branch types to make available.
  - name: Commit statuses
    description: |
      Commit statuses provide a way to tag commits with meta data,
      like automated build results.
  - name: Commits
    description: |
      These are the repository's commits. They are paginated and returned in
      reverse chronological order, similar to the output of git log.
  - name: Deployments
    description: |
      Teams are deploying code faster than ever, thanks to continuous
      delivery practices and tools like Bitbucket Pipelines. Bitbucket
      Deployments gives teams visibility into their deployment
      environments and helps teams to track how far changes have
      progressed in their deployment pipeline.
  - name: Downloads
    description: Access the list of download links associated with the repository.
  - name: Issue tracker
    description: >
      The issue resources provide functionality for getting information on

      issues in an issue tracker, creating new issues, updating them and
      deleting

      them.


      You can access public issues without authentication, but you can't gain
      access

      to private repositories' issues. By authenticating, you will get the
      ability

      to create issues, as well as access to updating data or deleting issues
      you

      have access to. Issue Tracker features are not supported for repositories
      in workspaces administered through admin.atlassian.com.
  - name: Pipelines
    description: |
      Bitbucket Pipelines brings continuous delivery to Bitbucket
      Cloud, empowering teams with full branching to deployment
      visibility and faster feedback loops.
  - name: Projects
    description: |
      Bitbucket Cloud projects make it easier for teams to focus on
      a goal, product, or process by organizing their repositories.
  - name: Pullrequests
    description: |
      Pull requests are a feature that makes it easier for developers
      to collaborate using Bitbucket. They provide a user-friendly web
      interface for discussing proposed changes before integrating them
      into the official project.
  - name: Refs
    description: |
      The refs resource allows you access branches and tags in a repository.
      By default, results will be in the order the underlying source control
      system returns them and identical to the ordering one sees when running
      "$ git show-ref". Note that this follows simple lexical ordering of the
       ref names.
  - name: Reports
    description: |
      Code insights provides reports, annotations, and metrics to help you
      and your team improve code quality in pull requests throughout the code
      review process. Some of the available code insights are static analysis
      reports, security scan results, artifact links, unit tests, and build
      status.
  - name: Repositories
    description: |
      A Git repository is a virtual storage of your project. It
      allows you to save versions of your code, which you can access
      when needed. The repo resource allows you to access public repos,
      or repos that belong to a specific workspace.
  - name: Snippets
    description: |
      Snippets allow you share code segments or files with yourself, members of
      your workspace, or the world.

      Like pull requests, repositories and workspaces, the full set of snippets
      is defined by what the current user has access to. This includes all
      snippets owned by any of the workspaces the user is a member of, or
      snippets by other users that the current user is either watching or has
       collaborated on (for instance by commenting on it).
  - name: Sources
    description: |-
      Browse the source code in the repository and
                                    create new commits by uploading.
  - name: Ssh
    description: |
      The SSH resource allows you to manage SSH keys.
  - name: Teams
    description: |
      The teams resource has been deprecated, and the workspaces
      endpoint should be used instead.

      The teams resource returns all the teams that the authenticated
      user is associated with.
  - name: Users
    description: |
      The users resource allows you to access public information
      associated with a user account. Most resources in the users
      endpoint have been deprecated in favor of workspaces.
  - name: Webhooks
    description: >
      Webhooks provide a way to configure Bitbucket Cloud to make requests to

      your server (or another external service) whenever certain events occur in

      Bitbucket Cloud.


      A webhook consists of:


      * A subject -- The resource that generates the events. Currently, this
      resource

      is the repository, user account, or team where you create the webhook.

      * One or more event -- The default event is a repository push, but you can

      select multiple events that can trigger the webhook.

      * A URL -- The endpoint where you want Bitbucket to send the event
      payloads

      when a matching event happens.


      There are two parts to getting a webhook to work: creating the webhook and

      triggering the webhook. After you create a webhook for an event, every
      time

      that event occurs, Bitbucket sends a payload request that describes the
      event

      to the specified URL. Thus, you can think of webhooks as a kind of

      notification system.


      Use webhooks to integrate applications with Bitbucket Cloud. The following

      use cases provides examples of when you would want to use webhooks:


      * Every time a user pushes commits in a repository, you may want to notify

      your CI server to start a build.

      * Every time a user pushes commits or creates a pull request, you may want
      to

      display a notification in your application.
  - name: Wiki
    description: |
      The wiki is a simple place to keep documents. Some people use it
      as their project home page. The wiki is a Git repository, so you
      can clone it and edit it like any other source files.
  - name: Workspaces
    description: |
      A workspace is where you create repositories, collaborate on
      your code, and organize different streams of work in your Bitbucket
      Cloud account. Workspaces replace the use of teams and users in API
      calls.

        ### Basic auth


        Basic HTTP Authentication as per
        [RFC-2617](https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc2617) (Digest not supported).

        Note that Basic Auth is available only with username and [app
        password](https://bitbucket.org/account/settings/app-passwords/) as
        credentials.


        ### Access Tokens


        Access Tokens are passwords (or tokens) that provide access to a
        _single_ repository, project or workspace.

        These tokens can authenticate with Bitbucket APIs for scripting, CI/CD
        tools, Bitbucket Cloud-connected apps,

        and Bitbucket Cloud integrations.


        Access Tokens are linked to a repository, project, or workspace, not a
        user account.

        The level of access provided by the token is set when a repository, or
        workspace admin creates it,

        by setting permission scopes.


        There are three types of Access Token:


        * **Repository Access Tokens** can connect to a single repository,
        preventing them from accessing any other repositories or workspaces.

        * **Project Access Tokens** can connect to a single project, providing
        access to any repositories within the project.

        * **Workspace Access Tokens** can connect to a single workspace and have
        access to any projects and repositories within that workspace.


        When using Bitbucket APIs with an Access Token, the token will be
        treated as the "user" in the

        Bitbucket UI and Bitbucket logs. This includes when using the Access
        Token to leave a comment on a pull request,

        push a commit, or merge a pull request. The Bitbucket UI and API
        responses will show the

        Repository/Project/Workspace Access Token as a user. The username shown
        in the Bitbucket UI is the Access

        Token _name_, and a custom icon is used to differentiate it from a
        regular user in the UI.


        #### Considerations for using Access Tokens


        * After creation, an Access Token can't be viewed or modified. The
        token's name, created date,

        last accessed date, and scopes are visible on the repository, project,
        or workspace **Access Tokens** page.

        * Access Tokens can access a limited set of Bitbucket's permission
        scopes.

        * Provided you set the correct permission scopes, you can use an Access
        Token to clone (`repository`)

        and push (`repository:write`) code to the token's repository or the
        repositories the token can access.

        * You can't use an Access Token to log into the Bitbucket website.

        * Access Tokens don't require two-step verification.

        * You can set permission scopes (specific access rights) for each Access
        Token.

        * You can't use an Access Token to manipulate or query repository,
        project, or workspace permissions.

        * Access Tokens are not listed in any repository or workspace permission
        API response.

        * Access Tokens are deactivated when deleting the resource tied to it (a
        repository, project, or workspace).

        Repository Access Tokens are also revoked when transferring the
        repository to another workspace.

        * Any content created by the Access Token will persist after the Access
        Token has been revoked.

        * Access Tokens can interact with branch restriction APIs, but the token
        can't be configured as a user with merge access when using branch
        restrictions.


        There are some APIs which are inaccessible for Access Tokens, these are:


        * [Add a repository deploy
        key](/cloud/bitbucket/rest/api-group-deployments/#api-repositories-workspace-repo-slug-deploy-keys-post)

        * [Update a repository deploy
        key](/cloud/bitbucket/rest/api-group-deployments/#api-repositories-workspace-repo-slug-deploy-keys-key-id-put)

        * [Delete a repository deploy
        key](/cloud/bitbucket/rest/api-group-deployments/#api-repositories-workspace-repo-slug-deploy-keys-key-id-delete)

        ### App passwords


        App passwords allow users to make API calls to their Bitbucket account
        through apps such as Sourcetree.


        Some important points about app passwords:


        * You cannot view an app password or adjust permissions after you create
        the app password. Because app passwords are encrypted on our database
        and cannot be viewed by anyone. They are essentially designed to be
        disposable. If you need to change the scopes or lost the password just
        create a new one.

        * You cannot use them to log into your Bitbucket account.

        * You cannot use app passwords to manage team actions.

            App passwords are tied to an individual account's credentials and should not be shared. If you're sharing your app password you're essentially giving direct, authenticated, access to everything that password has been scoped to do with the Bitbucket API's.

        * You can use them for API call authentication, even if you don't have
        two-step verification enabled.

        * You can set permission scopes (specific access rights) for each app
        password.


        For details on creating, managing, and using App passwords, visit

        [App
        passwords](https://support.atlassian.com/bitbucket-cloud/docs/app-passwords/).


        ### OAuth 2.0


        Our OAuth 2 implementation is merged in with our existing OAuth 1 in

        such a way that existing OAuth 1 consumers automatically become

        valid OAuth 2 clients. The only thing you need to do is edit your

        existing consumer and configure a callback URL.


        Once that is in place, you'll have the following 2 URLs:

            https://bitbucket.org/site/oauth2/authorize
            https://bitbucket.org/site/oauth2/access_token

        For obtaining access/bearer tokens, we support three of RFC-6749's grant

        flows, plus a custom Bitbucket flow for exchanging JWT tokens for access
        tokens.

        Note that Resource Owner Password Credentials Grant (4.3) is no longer
        supported.



        #### 1. Authorization Code Grant (4.1)


        The full-blown 3-LO flow. Request authorization from the end user by

        sending their browser to:

            https://bitbucket.org/site/oauth2/authorize?client_id={client_id}&response_type=code

        The callback includes the `?code={}` query parameter that you can swap

        for an access token:

            $ curl -X POST -u "client_id:secret" \
              https://bitbucket.org/site/oauth2/access_token \
              -d grant_type=authorization_code -d code={code}


        #### 2. Implicit Grant (4.2)


        This flow is useful for browser-based add-ons that operate without
        server-side backends.


        Request the end user for authorization by directing the browser to:

            https://bitbucket.org/site/oauth2/authorize?client_id={client_id}&response_type=token

        That will redirect to your preconfigured callback URL with a fragment

        containing the access token

        (`#access_token={token}&token_type=bearer`) where your page's js can

        pull it out of the URL.



        #### 3. Client Credentials Grant (4.4)


        Somewhat like our existing "2-LO" flow for OAuth 1. Obtain an access

        token that represents not an end user, but the owner of the

        client/consumer:

            $ curl -X POST -u "client_id:secret" \
              https://bitbucket.org/site/oauth2/access_token \
              -d grant_type=client_credentials


        #### 4. Bitbucket Cloud JWT Grant (urn:bitbucket:oauth2:jwt)


        If your Atlassian Connect add-on uses JWT authentication, you can swap a

        JWT for an OAuth access token. The resulting access token represents the

        account for which the add-on is installed.


        Make sure you send the JWT token in the Authorization request header

        using the "JWT" scheme (case sensitive). Note that this custom scheme

        makes this different from HTTP Basic Auth (and so you cannot use "curl

        -u").

            $ curl -X POST -H "Authorization: JWT {jwt_token}" \
              https://bitbucket.org/site/oauth2/access_token \
              -d grant_type=urn:bitbucket:oauth2:jwt


        #### Making Requests


        Once you have an access token, as per RFC-6750, you can use it in a
        request in any of

        the following ways (in decreasing order of desirability):


        1. Send it in a request header: `Authorization: Bearer {access_token}`

        2. Include it in a (application/x-www-form-urlencoded) POST body as
        `access_token={access_token}`

        3. Put it in the query string of a non-POST:
        `?access_token={access_token}`



        #### Repository Cloning


        Since add-ons will not be able to upload their own SSH keys to clone

        with, access tokens can be used as Basic HTTP Auth credentials to

        clone securely over HTTPS. This is much like GitHub, yet slightly

        different:

            $ git clone https://x-token-auth:{access_token}@bitbucket.org/user/repo.git

        The literal string `x-token-auth` as a substitute for username is

        required (note the difference with GitHub where the actual token is in

        the username field).



        #### Refresh Tokens


        Our access tokens expire in one hour. When this happens you'll get 401

        responses.


        Most access tokens grant responses (Implicit and JWT excluded).
        Therefore, you should include a

        refresh token that can then be used to generate a new access token,

        without the need for end user participation:

            $ curl -X POST -u "client_id:secret" \
              https://bitbucket.org/site/oauth2/access_token \
              -d grant_type=refresh_token -d refresh_token={refresh_token}


        ### Bitbucket OAuth 2.0 scopes


        Bitbucket's API applies a number of privilege scopes to endpoints. In
        order to access an endpoint, a request will need to have the necessary
        scopes.


        OAuth 2.0 Scopes are applicable for OAuth 2, Access Tokens, and App
        passwords auth mechanisms as well as Bitbucket Connect apps.


        Scopes are declared in the descriptor as a list of strings, with each
        string being the name of a unique scope.


        A descriptor lacking the `scopes` element is implicitly assumed to
        require all scopes and as a result, Bitbucket will require end users
        authorizing/installing the add-on

        to explicitly accept all scopes.


        Our best practice suggests you add only the scopes your add-on needs,
        but no more than it needs.


        Invalid scope strings will cause the descriptor to be rejected and the
        installation to fail.


        The available scopes are:


        - [project](#project)

        - [project:write](#project-write)

        - [project:admin](#project-admin)

        - [repository](#repository)

        - [runner](#runner)

        - [runner:write](#runner-write)


        #### project


        Provides access to view the project or projects.

        This scope implies the [`repository`](#repository) scope, giving read
        access to all the repositories in a project or projects.


        #### project:write


        This scope is deprecated, and has been made obsolete by `project:admin`.
        Please see the deprecation notice
        [here](/cloud/bitbucket/deprecation-notice-project-write-scope).


        #### project:admin


        Provides admin access to a project or projects. No distinction is made
        between public and private projects. This scope doesn't implicitly grant
        the [`project`](#project) scope or the
        [`repository:write`](#repository-write) scope on any repositories under
        the project. It gives access to the admin features of a project only,
        not direct access to its repositories' contents.


        * ability to create the project

        * ability to update the project

        * ability to delete the project


        #### repository


        Provides read access to a repository or repositories.

        Note that this scope does not give access to a repository's pull
        requests.


        * access to the repo's source code

        * clone over HTTPS

        * access the file browsing API

        * download zip archives of the repo's contents

        * the ability to view and use the issue tracker on any repo (created
        issues, comment, vote, etc)

        * the ability to view and use the wiki on any repo (create/edit pages)


        #### repository:write


        Provides write (not admin) access to a repository or repositories. No
        distinction is made between public and private repositories. This scope
        implicitly grants the [`repository`](#repository) scope, which does not
        need to be requested separately.

        This scope alone does not give access to the pull requests API.


        * push access over HTTPS

        * fork repos


        #### repository:admin


        Provides admin access to a repository or repositories. No distinction is
        made between public and private repositories. This scope doesn't
        implicitly grant the [`repository`](#repository) or the
        [`repository:write`](#repository-write) scopes. It gives access to the
        admin features of a repo only, not direct access to its contents. This
        scope can be used or misused to grant read access to other users, who
        can then clone the repo, but users that need to read and write source
        code would also request explicit read or write.

        This scope comes with access to the following functionality:


        * View and manipulate committer mappings

        * List and edit deploy keys

        * Ability to delete the repo

        * View and edit repo permissions

        * View and edit branch permissions

        * Import and export the issue tracker

        * Enable and disable the issue tracker

        * List and edit issue tracker version, milestones and components

        * Enable and disable the wiki

        * List and edit default reviewers

        * List and edit repo links (Jira/Bamboo/Custom)

        * List and edit the repository webhooks

        * Initiate a repo ownership transfer


        #### repository:delete


        Provides access to delete a repository or repositories.


        #### pullrequest


        Provides read access to pull requests.

        This scope implies the [`repository`](#repository) scope, giving read
        access to the pull request's destination repository.


        * see and list pull requests

        * create and resolve tasks

        * comment on pull requests


        #### pullrequest:write


        Implicitly grants the [`pullrequest`](#pullrequest) scope and adds the
        ability to create, merge and decline pull requests.

        This scope also implicitly grants the
        [`repository:write`](#repository-write) scope, giving write access to
        the pull request's destination repository. This is necessary to allow
        merging.


        * merge pull requests

        * decline pull requests

        * create pull requests

        * approve pull requests


        #### issue


        Ability to interact with issue trackers the way non-repo members can.

        This scope doesn't implicitly grant any other scopes and doesn't give
        implicit access to the repository.


        * view, list and search issues

        * create new issues

        * comment on issues

        * watch issues

        * vote for issues


        #### issue:write


        This scope implicitly grants the [`issue`](#issue) scope and adds the
        ability to transition and delete issues.

        This scope doesn't implicitly grant any other scopes and doesn't give
        implicit access to the repository.


        * transition issues

        * delete issues


        #### wiki


        Provides access to wikis. This scope provides both read and write access
        (wikis are always editable by anyone with access to them).

        This scope doesn't implicitly grant any other scopes and doesn't give
        implicit access to the repository.


        * view wikis

        * create pages

        * edit pages

        * push to wikis

        * clone wikis


        #### webhook


        Gives access to webhooks. This scope is required for any webhook-related
        operation.


        This scope gives read access to existing webhook subscriptions on all

        resources the authorization mechanism can access, without needing
        further scopes.

        For example:


        - A client can list all existing webhook subscriptions on a repository.
        The [`repository`](#repository) scope is not required.

        - Existing webhook subscriptions for the issue tracker on a repo can be
        retrieved without the [`issue`](#issue) scope. All that is required is
        the `webhook` scope.


        To create webhooks, the client will need read access to the resource.
        Such as: for [`issue:created`](#issue-created), the client will need to

        have both the `webhook` and the [`issue`](#issue) scope.


        * list webhook subscriptions on any accessible repository, user, team,
        or snippet

        * create/update/delete webhook subscriptions.


        #### snippet


        Provides read access to snippets.

        No distinction is made between public and private snippets (public
        snippets are accessible without any form of authentication).


        * view any snippet

        * create snippet comments


        #### snippet:write


        Provides write access to snippets.

        No distinction is made between public and private snippets (public
        snippets are accessible without any form of authentication).

        This scope implicitly grants the [`snippet`](#snippet) scope which does
        not need to be requested separately.


        * create snippets

        * edit snippets

        * delete snippets


        #### email


        Ability to see the user's primary email address. This should make it
        easier to use Bitbucket Cloud as a login provider for apps or external
        applications.


        #### account


        When used for:

        * **user-related APIs** — Gives read-only access to the user's account
        information.

        Note that this doesn't include any ability to change any of the data.
        This scope allows you to view the user's:
          * email addresses
          * language
          * location
          * website
          * full name
          * SSH keys
          * user groups
        * **workspace-related APIs** — Grants access to view the workspace's:
          * users
          * user permissions
          * projects

        #### account:write


        Ability to change properties on the user's account.


        * delete the authorizing user's account

        * manage the user's groups

        * change a user's email addresses

        * change username, display name and avatar


        #### pipeline


        Gives read-only access to pipelines, steps, deployment environments and
        variables.


        #### pipeline:write


        Gives write access to pipelines. This scope allows a user to:

        * Stop pipelines

        * Rerun failed pipelines

        * Resume halted pipelines

        * Trigger manual pipelines.


        This scope is not needed to trigger a build using a push. Performing a
        `git push` (or equivalent actions) will trigger the build. The token
        doing the push only needs the [`repository:write`](#repository-write)
        scope.


        This doesn't give write access to create variables.


        #### pipeline:variable


        Gives write access to create variables in pipelines at the various
        levels:

        * Workspace

        * Repository

        * Deployment


        #### runner


        Gives read-only access to pipelines runners setup against a workspace or
        repository.


        #### runner:write


        Gives write access to create/edit/disable/delete pipelines runners setup
        against a workspace or repository.

        ### Forge app scopes


        In order for a Forge app integration to access Bitbucket API endpoints,
        it needs to include certain privilege scopes in the app manifest. These
        are different from Bitbucket OAuth 2.0 scopes.


        Unlike OAuth 2.0 scopes, Forge app scopes do not implicitly grant other
        scopes, for example, `write:repository:bitbucket` does not implicitly
        grant `read:repository:bitbucket`.


        Only a subset of Bitbucket API endpoints are currently available for
        Forge app integrations. These will be labeled with Forge app scopes.


        Our best practice suggests you only add the scopes your app needs, but
        no more than it needs.


        The available scopes are:


        - [`read:repository:bitbucket`](#read-repository-bitbucket)

        - [`write:repository:bitbucket`](#write-repository-bitbucket)

        - [`admin:repository:bitbucket`](#admin-repository-bitbucket)

        - [`delete:repository:bitbucket`](#delete-repository-bitbucket)

        - [`read:pullrequest:bitbucket`](#read-pullrequest-bitbucket)

        - [`write:pullrequest:bitbucket`](#write-pullrequest-bitbucket)

        - [`read:project:bitbucket`](#read-project-bitbucket)

        - [`admin:project:bitbucket`](#admin-project-bitbucket)

        - [`read:workspace:bitbucket`](#read-workspace-bitbucket)

        - [`read:user:bitbucket`](#read-user-bitbucket)

        - [`read:pipeline:bitbucket`](#read-pipeline-bitbucket)

        - [`write:pipeline:bitbucket`](#write-pipeline-bitbucket)

        - [`admin:pipeline:bitbucket`](#admin-pipeline-bitbucket)

        - [`read:runner:bitbucket`](#read-runner-bitbucket)

        - [`write:runner:bitbucket`](#write-runner-bitbucket)


        #### read:repository:bitbucket


        Allows viewing of repository data. Note that this scope does not give
        access to a repository's pull requests.

        * access to the repository's source code

        * access the file browsing API

        * access to certain repository configurations such as branching model,
        default reviewers, etc.


        #### write:repository:bitbucket


        Allows modification of repository data. No distinction is made between
        public and private repositories. This scope does not imply the
        `read:repository:bitbucket` scope, so you need to request that
        separately if required. This scope alone does not give access to the
        pull request API.

        * update/delete source, branches, tags, etc.

        * fork repositories


        #### admin:repository:bitbucket


        Allows admin activities on repositories. No distinction is made between
        public and private repositories. This scope does not implicitly grant
        the `read:repository:bitbucket` or the `write:repository:bitbucket`
        scopes. It gives access to the admin features of a repository only, not
        direct access to its contents. This scope does not allow modification of
        repository permissions. This scope comes with access to the following
        functionality:

        * create repository

        * view repository permissions

        * view and edit branch restrictions

        * edit branching model settings

        * edit default reviewers

        * view and edit inheritance state for repository settings


        #### delete:repository:bitbucket

        Allows deletion of repositories.


        #### read:pullrequest:bitbucket

        Allows viewing of pull requests, plus the ability to comment on pull
        requests.


        This scope does not imply the `read:repository:bitbucket` scope. With
        this scope, you could retrieve some data specific to the
        source/destination repositories of a pull request using pull request
        endpoints, but it does not give access to repository API endpoints.


        #### write:pullrequest:bitbucket

        Allows the ability to create, update, approve, decline, and merge pull
        requests.


        This scope does not imply the `write:repository:bitbucket` scope.


        #### read:project:bitbucket

        Allows viewing of project and project permission data.


        #### admin:project:bitbucket

        Allows the ability to create, update, and delete project. No distinction
        is made between public and private projects.


        This scope does not implicitly grant the `read:project:bitbucket` scope
        or any repository scopes. It gives access to the admin features of a
        project only, not direct access to its repositories' contents.


        #### read:workspace:bitbucket

        Allows viewing of workspace and workspace permission data.


        #### read:user:bitbucket

        Allows viewing of user data. This scope is typically required for
        permission related endpoints.


        #### read:pipeline:bitbucket

        Allows read access to all pipeline information (pipelines, steps,
        caches, artifacts, logs, tests, code-insights).


        #### write:pipeline:bitbucket

        Allows running pipelines (i.e., start/stop/create pipeline) and
        uploading tests/code-insights.


        This scope does not imply the `read:pipeline:bitbucket` scope.


        #### admin:pipeline:bitbucket

        Allows admin activities, such as creating pipeline variables.


        This scope does not implicitly grant the `read:pipeline:bitbucket` or
        the `write:pipeline:bitbucket` scopes.


        #### read:runner:bitbucket

        Allows viewing of runners information.


        #### write:runner:bitbucket

        Allows runners management.


        This scope does not imply the `read:runners:bitbucket` scope.

      body: "\nYou can query the 2.0 API for specific objects using a simple language which resembles SQL.\n\nNote that filtering and querying by username has been deprecated, due to privacy changes. \nSee the [announcement](https://developer.atlassian.com/cloud/bitbucket/bitbucket-api-changes-gdpr/#changes-to-querying) \nfor details.\n\n---\n\n* [Supported endpoints](#supported-endpoints)\n* [Operators](#operators)\n* [Data types](#data-types)\n* [Querying](#querying)\n* [Sorting query results](#sorting-query-results)\n\n----\n\n### Supported endpoints\n\nMost 2.0 API resources that return paginated collections of objects support a single, shared, generic querying language that is used to filter down a result set.\n\nThis includes, but is in no way limited to:\n\n    /2.0/repositories/{username}\n    /2.0/repositories/{username}/{slug}/refs\n    /2.0/repositories/{username}/{slug}/refs/branches\n    /2.0/repositories/{username}/{slug}/refs/tags\n    /2.0/repositories/{username}/{slug}/forks\n    /2.0/repositories/{username}/{slug}/src\n    /2.0/repositories/{username}/{slug}/issues\n    /2.0/repositories/{username}/{slug}/pullrequests\n\nFiltering and sorting supports several distinct operators and data types as well as basic features, like logical operators (AND, OR).\nAs examples, the following queries could be used on the issue tracker endpoint (`/2.0/repositories/{workspace}/{slug}/issues/`):\n\n\t(state = \"open\" OR state = \"new\") AND assignee = null\n\treporter.nickname != \"evzijst\" AND priority >= \"major\"\n\t(title ~ \"unicode\" OR content.raw ~ \"unicode\") AND created_on > 2015-10-04T14:00:00-07:00\n\nFilter queries can be added to the URL using the q=<query> query parameter. To sort the response, add sort=<field>. Note that the entire query string is put in the q parameter and hence needs to be URL-encoded as shown in the following example:\n\n\t/2.0/repositories/foo/bar/issues?q=state=\"new\"&sort=-updated_on\n\n\n### Operators\n\nFiltering and sorting supports the following operators:\n\n| Operator | Definition                     | Example                    |\n|----------|--------------------------------|----------------------------|\n| \"=\"      | test for equality              | `nickname = \"evzijst\"`     |\n| \"!=\"     | not equal                      | `is_private != true`       |\n| \"~\"      | case-insensitive text contains | `description ~ \"beef\"`     |\n| \"!~\"     | case-insensitive not contains  | `description !~ \"fubar\"`   |\n| \">\"      | greater than                   | `priority > \"major\"`       |\n| \">=\"     | greater than or equal          | `priority <= \"trivial\"`    |\n| \"<\"      | less than                      | `id < 1234`                |\n| \"<=\"     | less than or equal             | `updated_on <= 2015-03-04` |\n\n### Data types\n\nFiltering and sorting supports the following data types:\n\n| Type         | Description                             | Example       |\n|--------------|-----------------------------------------|---------------|\n| **String**   | any text inside double quotes           | `\"foo\"`       |\n| **Number**   | arbitrary precision integers and floats | `1, -10.302`  |\n| **Null**     | to test for the absence of a value      | `null`        |\n| **boolean**  | the unquoted strings true or false      | `true, false` |\n| **datetime** | an unquoted [ISO-8601][iso-8601] date time string with the timezone offset, milliseconds and entire time component being optional | `2015-03-04T14:08:59.123+02:00`, `2015-03-04T14:08:59` Date time strings are assumed to be in UTC, unless an explicit timezone offset is provided |\n\n[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ISO_8601]: /iso-8601\n\n### Querying\n\nObjects can be filtered based on their properties. In principle, every element in an object's JSON document schema can be used as a filter criterion.\n\nNote that while the array of objects in a paginated response is wrapped in an\nenvelope with a `values` element, this prefix should not be included in the\nquery fields (so use `/2.0/repositories/foo/bar/issues?q=state=\"new\"`, not\n`/2.0/repositories/foo/bar/issues?q=values.state=\"new\"`).\n\n\n### Examples\n\nFields that contain embedded instances of other object types (e.g. owner is an embedded user object, while parent is an embedded repository) can be traversed recursively. For instance:\n\n\tparent.owner.nickname = \"bitbucket\"\n\nTo find pull requests which merge into master, come from a fork of the repo rather than a branch inside the repo, and on which I am a reviewer:\n\n```\nsource.repository.full_name != \"main/repo\" AND state = \"OPEN\" AND reviewers.nickname = \"evzijst\" AND destination.branch.name = \"master\"\n```\n```\n/2.0/repositories/main/repo/pullrequests?q=source.repository.full_name+%21%3D+%22main%2Frepo%22+AND+state+%3D+%22OPEN%22+AND+reviewers.nickname+%3D+%22evzijst%22+AND+destination.branch.name+%3D+%22master%22\n```\n\nTo find new or on-hold issues related to the UI, created or updated in the last day (SF local time), that have not yet been assigned to anyone:\n\n```\n(state = \"new\" OR state = \"on hold\") AND assignee = null AND component = \"UI\" and updated_on > 2015-11-11T00:00:00-07:00\n```\n```\n/2.0/repositories/main/repo/issues?q=%28state+%3D+%22new%22+OR+state+%3D+%22on+hold%22%29+AND+assignee+%3D+null+AND+component+%3D+%22UI%22+and+updated_on+%3E+2015-11-11T00%3A00%3A00-07%3A00\n```\n\nTo find all tags with the string \"2015\" in the name:\n\n```\nname ~ \"2015\"\n```\n```\n/2.0/repositories/{username}/{slug}/refs/tags?q=name+%7E+%222015%22\n```\nOr all my branches:\n\n```\nname ~ \"erik/\"\n```\n```\n/2.0/repositories/{username}/{slug}/refs/?q=name+%7E+%22erik%2F%22\n```\n### Sorting query results\n\nYou can sort result sets using the ?sort=<field> query parameter, available on the same resources that support filtering:\n\n* In principle, every field that can be queried can also be used as a key for sorting.\n* By default the sort order is ascending. To reverse the order, prefix the field name with a hyphen (e.g. ?sort=-updated_on).\n* Only one field can be sorted on. Compound fields (e.g. sort on state first, followed by updated_on) are not supported.\n\n\n"

        Endpoints that return collections of objects should always apply
        pagination.

        Paginated collections are always wrapped in the following wrapper
        object:


        ```json

        {
          "size": 5421,
          "page": 2,
          "pagelen": 10,
          "next": "https://api.bitbucket.org/2.0/repositories/pypy/pypy/commits?page=3",
          "previous": "https://api.bitbucket.org/2.0/repositories/pypy/pypy/commits?page=1",
          "values": [
            ...
          ]
        }

        ```


        Pagination is often page-bound, with a query parameter page indicating
        which

        page is to be returned.


        However, clients are not expected to construct URLs themselves by
        manipulating

        the page number query parameter. Instead, the response contains a link
        to the

        next page. This link should be treated as an opaque location that is not
        to be

        constructed by clients or even assumed to be predictable. The only
        contract

        around the next link is that it will return the next chunk of results.


        Lack of a next link in the response indicates the end of the collection.


        The paginated response contains the following fields:


        | Field      | Value    |

        |------------|----------|

        | `size`     | Total number of objects in the response. This is an
        optional element that is not provided in all responses, as it can be
        expensive to compute. |

        | `page`     | Page number of the current results. This is an optional
        element that is not provided in all responses. |

        | `pagelen`  | Current number of objects on the existing page. Globally,
        the minimum length is 10 and the maximum is 100. Some APIs may specify a
        different default. |

        | `next`     | Link to the next page if it exists. The last page of a
        collection does not have this value. Use this link to navigate the
        result set and refrain from constructing your own URLs. |

        | `previous` | Link to previous page if it exists. A collections first
        page does not have this value. This is an optional element that is not
        provided in all responses. Some result sets strictly support forward
        navigation and never provide previous links. Clients must anticipate
        that backwards navigation is not always available. Use this link to
        navigate the result set and refrain from constructing your own URLs. |

        | `values`   | The list of objects. This contains at most `pagelen`
        objects. |


        The link to the next page is included such that you don't have to
        hardcode or construct any links.  Only values and next are guaranteed
        (except the last page, which lacks next). This is because the previous
        and size values can be expensive for some data sets.


        It is important to realize that Bitbucket support both list-based
        pagination and iterator-based pagination. List-based pagination assumes
        that the collection is a discrete, immutable, consistently ordered,
        finite array of objects with a fixed size. Clients navigate a list-based
        collection by requesting offset-based chunks. In Bitbucket Cloud,
        list-based responses include the optional size, page, and previous
        element. The the next and previous links typically resemble something
        like /foo/bar?page=4.


        However, not all result sets can be treated as immutable and finite –
        much like how programming languages tend to distinguish between lists
        and arrays on one hand and iterators or stream on the other. Where an
        list-based pagination offers random access into any point in a
        collection, iterator-based pagination can only navigate forward one
        element at a time. In Bitbucket such iterator-based pagination contains
        the next link and pagelen elements, but not necessarily anything else.
        In these cases, the next link's value often contains an unpredictable
        hash instead of an explicit page number. The commits resource uses
        iterator-based pagination.

        By default, each endpoint returns the full representation of a resource
        and in

        some cases that can be a lot of data. For example, retrieving a list of
        pull

        requests can amount to quite a large document.


        For better performance, you can ask the server to only return the fields
        you

        really need and to omit unwanted data. To request a partial response and
        to

        add or remove specific fields from a response, use the `fields` query

        parameter.



        ### Example


        Most API resources embed a substantial list of links pointing to related

        resources. This saves the client from constructing its own URLs, but is

        somewhat wasteful when the client doesn't need them.


        To significantly reduce the size of the response, use `?fields=-links`:


        ```json

        $ curl https://api.bitbucket.org/2.0/users/evzijst?fields=-links

        {
          "nickname": "evzijst",
          "account_status": "active",
          "website": "",
          "display_name": "Erik van Zijst",
          "uuid": "{a288a0ab-e13b-43f0-a689-c4ef0a249875}",
          "created_on": "2010-07-07T05:16:36+00:00",
          "location": null,
          "type": "user"
        }

        ```


        ### Fields parameter syntax


        The `fields` parameter supports 3 modes of operation:


        1. Removal of select fields (e.g. `-links`)

        2. Pulling in additional fields not normally returned by an endpoint,
        while
           still getting all the default fields (e.g. `+reviewers`)
        3. Omitting all fields, except those specified (e.g.
        `owner.display_name`)


        The fields parameter can contain a list of multiple comma-separated
        field names

        (e.g. `fields=owner.display_name,uuid,links.self.href`). The parameter
        itself is

        not repeated.


        As discussed at [Condensed Versus Full
        Objects](serialization#representations),

        most objects that are embedded inside other objects (like how `owner` is
        an

        embedded `user` object in `repository`) appear in "condensed" form that
        omits

        many fields. The `fields` parameter allows us to pull in additional
        fields in

        such cases.


        For example, the embedded repository object in a pull request does not
        normally

        contain its `owner`. To add that in we can use:

        `+values.destination.repository.owner`.



        ### Wildcards


        The asterisk can be used to match all fields on a particular level. For

        example, removing all entries from the `links` element can be done like
        this:


        ```json

        $ curl https://api.bitbucket.org/2.0/users/evzijst?fields=-links.*

        {
          "nickname": "evzijst",
          "account_status": "active",
          "website": "",
          "display_name": "Erik van Zijst",
          "uuid": "{a288a0ab-e13b-43f0-a689-c4ef0a249875}",
          "links": {},
          "created_on": "2010-07-07T05:16:36+00:00",
          "location": null,
          "type": "user"
        }

        ```


        Wildcards can be used in combination with exclusion and inclusion. For

        instance, `-*,+foo,+bar` will remove all elements from the root level
        and then

        add in `foo` and `bar`.



        ### URL encoding


        Be aware that when using the `+foo.bar` syntax in the query string, that
        the

        "+" must be URL encoded as "%2B" and so the URL will be:


        ```

        https://api.bitbucket.org/2.0/repositories/evzijst/interruptingcow?fields=%2Bowner.created_on

        ```


        Without URL escaping, "+" is interpreted as an encoded space which will
        not

        match any fields.



        ### Field discovery


        While a resource's `self` URL, as well its "collection" URL typically
        return

        the full object with all its fields, there are some exceptions for
        fields that

        are overly verbose or costly to generate.


        For instance, a pull request contains the embedded lists of reviewers
        and

        participants. These fields are included from the `self` URL, but not
        from the

        `/pullrequests` collections resource, as it would impact performance too
        much.


        To discover any additional fields that might not be included by default,

        `fields=*` can be used.



        ### More examples


        If we want to get a list of all reviewer nicknames on pull requests I
        created,

        we could combine a [filter](filtering) with a partial response. This
        will omit

        all other data from the response:


        ```

        /2.0/repositories/bitbucket/bitbucket/pullrequests?fields=values.id,values.reviewers.nickname,values.state&q=author.uuid%3D%22%7Bd301aafa-d676-4ee0-88be-962be7417567%7D%22

        ### Open API Specification


        Bitbucket uses the [Open API Specification](https://openapis.org) (OAI,

        formerly known as Swagger) to describe its APIs. Our OAI specification
        schema

        is hosted at
        [https://api.bitbucket.org/swagger.json](https://api.bitbucket.org/swagger.json)

        and serves as the canonical definition and comprehensive declaration of
        all

        available endpoints.


        The OAI specification makes writing client applications easier by:

        auto-generating boilerplate code (like data object classes) and dealing
        with

        authentication and error handling.


        You can find a comprehensive set of open tools for the OAI specification
        at:

        [https://github.com/swagger-api](https://github.com/swagger-api).



        ### JSON Schema


        Bitbucket uses JSON Schema to describe the layout of every type of
        object

        consumed or produced by the API. These schemas are collected under the

        `#definitions` element of our swagger.json file.


        When an endpoint expects an object as part of a POST or PUT, it also
        expects

        the object to validate against the JSON schemas. The same applies to
        objects

        returned by an endpoint.



        ### Condensed Versus Full Objects


        Most objects in Bitbucket come both in "full" and "partial"
        representation.

        The full representation is when all elements are included. This is the
        layout

        returned by a resource's `self` location (e.g.
        `/2.0/repositories/foo/bar`),

        as well as resource collection endpoints (e.g. `/2.0/repositories`).


        However, Bitbucket objects often embed other objects. For example, a
        `repository`

        object embeds a `user` object for its owner. Likewise, a `pullrequest`
        object

        embeds its `repository` object.


        These related objects are embedded, or inlined, to reduce the "chatter"
        when

        clients make frequent followup API calls to collect information on
        common,

        related information.


        Embedded related objects are typically limited in their fields to avoid
        such

        object graphs from becoming too deep and noisy. They often exclude their
        own

        nested objects in an attempt to strike a balance between performance and

        utility.


        An object's embedded or condensed representation tends to be
        standardized,

        meaning the fields included is the same set, regardless of where the
        object

        was embedded.

        You should be familiar with REST architecture before writing an
        integration. Read this overview page to gain a good understanding of
        Bitbucket's REST implementation.

        ### URI structure


        All Bitbucket Cloud requests start with the
        `https://api.bitbucket.org/2.0` prefix (for the 2.0 API) and
        `https://api.bitbucket.org/1.0` prefix (1.0 API).


        The next segment of the URI path depends on the endpoint of the request.
        For example, using the curl command and the repositories endpoint you
        can list all the issues on Bitbucket's tutorial repository:


        ```

        curl
        https://api.bitbucket.org/2.0/repositories/tutorials/tutorials.bitbucket.org

        ```

        Given a specific endpoint, you can then drill down to a particular
        aspect or resource of that endpoint. The issues resource on a repository
        is an example:


        ```

        curl
        https://api.bitbucket.org/1.0/repositories/tutorials/tutorials.bitbucket.org/issues

        ```


        #### HTTP methods


        A given endpoint or resource has a series of actions (or methods)
        associated with it. The Bitbucket service supports these standard HTTP
        methods:


        | Call | Description |

        |------|-------------|

        | GET    | Retrieves information. |

        | PUT    | Updates existing information. |

        | POST   | Creates new information. |

        | DELETE | Removes existing information. |


        For example, you can call use the POST action on the issues resource and
        create an issue on the issue tracker.


        **Specifying content length**


        You can get a `411 Length Required` response. If this happens, the API
        requires a Content-Length header but the client is not sending it. You
        should add the header yourself, for example using the curl client:


        ```

        curl -r PUT --header "Content-Length: 0" -u user:app_password
        https://api.bitbucket.org/1.0/emails/rap@atlassian.com

        ```


        ### Universally Unique Identifier


        UUID's provide a single point of recognition for users, teams, and
        repositories. The UUID is distinct from the username, team name, and
        repository name fields and remains the same even when those fields
        change. For example when a user changes their username or moves a
        repository you will need to modify calls which use those identifiers but
        not if you are pointing to the UUID.


        #### UUID examples and structure


        UUID's work with both the 1.0 and 2.0 APIs for the user, team, and
        repository objects. The following examples the following characters are
        replacements for curly brackets: `%7B` replaces `{`  and `%7D` replaces
        `}`. You will see this structure in the following example sections.


        #### User object and UUID


        When you make a call using either the username or the UUID for that user
        the response is the same.


        **Call with username**:


        ```

        curl https://api.bitbucket.org/2.0/users/tutorials

        ```


        ***Call with UUID for the user**:


        ```

        curl
        https://api.bitbucket.org/2.0/users/%7Bc788b2da-b7a2-404c-9e26-d3f077557007%7D

        ```

            "type": "user"
        }

        ```


        #### Repository object and UUID


        Once you have the UUID for a repository you no longer need a username or
        team name to make the API call so long as you use an empty field. This
        helps you resolve repositories no matter if the username or team name
        changes.


        **Call with team name (1team) and repository name (moxie)**:


        ```

        curl https://api.bitbucket.org/2.0/repositories/1team/moxie

        ```

        **Call with UUID and empty field**:


        ```

        curl
        https://api.bitbucket.org/2.0/repositories/%7B%7D/%7B21fa9bf8-b5b2-4891-97ed-d590bad0f871%7D

        ```


        **Call with UUID and teamname**:

        #### Team object and UUID


        This example shows a call for a list of team members using both the team
        name and with the UUID for the team object. As the call is
        unauthenticated in the following example the response object will only
        show members with public profiles. The response is the same in either
        case.


        **Call with teamname**


        ```

        curl https://api.bitbucket.org/2.0/teams/1team/members

        ```

        **Call with UUID for team object**


        ```

        curl
        https://api.bitbucket.org/2.0/teams/%7Baa559944-83c9-4963-a9a8-69ac8d9cf5d2%7D/members

        ### Standardized error responses


        The 2.0 API standardizes the error response layout. The 2.0 API serves a
        JSON

        object along with the appropriate HTTP status code. The JSON object
        provides a

        detailed  problem description.


        ```json

        {
            "type": "error",
            "error": {
                "message": "Bad request",
                "fields": {
                    "src": [
                        "This field is required."
                    ]
                },
                "detail": "You must specify a valid source branch when creating a pull request.",
                "id": "d23a1cc5178f7637f3d9bf2d13824258",
                "data": {
                  "extra": "Optional, endpoint-specific data to further augment the error."
                }
            }
        }

        ```


        This object contains an error element which contains the following
        nested

        elements:


        | Element | Description |

        |---------|-------------|

        | message | A short description of the problem. This element is always
        present. Its value may be localized. |

        | fields  | This optional element is used in response to POST or PUT
        operations in which clients have provided invalid input. It contains a
        list of one or more client-provided fields that failed validation. The
        values may be localized. |

        | detail  | An optional detailed explanation of the failure. Its value
        may be localized.

        | id      | An optional unique error identifier that identifies the
        error in Bitbucket's logging system. If you feel you hit a bug in an API
        and this field is provided, please mention it if you decide to contact
        support as it will greatly help us narrow down the problem. |


        ### Standard ISO-8601 timestamps


        All 2.0 APIs use standardized ISO-8601 timestamps. In most cases, our
        APIs return UTC timestamps and for these, the timezone offset part will
        be 00:00. In rare cases where the original localized timestamp has
        significance, the timezone offset may identify the event's original
        timezone.

        sharing](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cross-origin_resource_sharing)
        (CORS), what content types we support in requests and responses, and
        hyperlinking resources in each json responses.

        ### Cors


        The Bitbucket API supports Cross-origin resource sharing to allow
        requests for restricted resources across domains. For more information
        you can refer to:


        * [Wikipedia article on
        CORS](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cross-origin_resource_sharing)

        * [W3C CORS recommendation](https://www.w3.org/TR/cors/)


        Sending a general request from the api to bitbucket.com:


        `curl -i https://api.bitbucket.org -H "origin: http://bitbucket.com"`


        Gives this result:

        ### Supported content types


        The default and primary content type for 2.0 APIs is JSON. This applies
        both to responses from the server and to the request bodies provided by
        the client.


        Unless documented otherwise, whenever creating a new (POST) or modifying
        an existing (PUT) object, your client must provide the object's normal
        representation. Not every object element can be mutated. For example, a
        repository's created_on date is an auto-generated, immutable field. Your
        client can omit immutable fields from a request body.


        In some cases, a resource might also accept regular
        application/x-www-url-form-encoded POST and PUT bodies. Such bodies can
        be more convenient in scripts and command line usage. Requests bodies
        can contain contain nested elements or they can be flat (without nested
        elements). Clients can send flat request bodies as either as
        application/json or as application/x-www-url-form-encoded. Nested
        objects always require JSON.


        ### Resource links


        Every 2.0 object contains a links element that points to related
        resources or alternate representations. Use links to quickly discover
        and traverse to related objects. Links serve a "self-documenting"
        function for each endpoint. For example, the following request for a
        specific user:



        `$ curl https://api.bitbucket.org/2.0/users/tutorials`


        ```json

        {
            "username": "tutorials",
            "nickname": "tutorials",
            "account_status": "active",
            "website": "https://tutorials.bitbucket.org/",
            "display_name": "tutorials account",
            "uuid": "{c788b2da-b7a2-404c-9e26-d3f077557007}",
            "links": {
                "self": {
                    "href": "https://api.bitbucket.org/2.0/users/tutorials"
                },
                "repositories": {
                    "href": "https://api.bitbucket.org/2.0/repositories/tutorials"
                },
                "html": {
                    "href": "https://bitbucket.org/tutorials"
                },
                "followers": {
                    "href": "https://api.bitbucket.org/2.0/users/tutorials/followers"
                },
                "avatar": {
                    "href": "https://bitbucket-assetroot.s3.amazonaws.com/c/photos/2013/Nov/25/tutorials-avatar-1563784409-6_avatar.png"
                },
                "following": {
                    "href": "https://api.bitbucket.org/2.0/users/tutorials/following"
                }
            },
            "created_on": "2011-12-20T16:34:07.132459+00:00",
            "location": "Santa Monica, CA",
            "type": "user"
        }

        ```

        Links can be actual REST API resources or they can be informational. In
        this example, informative resources include the user's avatar and the
        HTML URL for the user's Bitbucket account. Your client should avoid
        hardcoding an API's URL and instead use the URLs returned in API
        responses.


        A link's key is its `rel` (relationship) attribute and it contains a
        mandatory href element. For example, the following link:


        ```json

        "self": {
              "href": "https://api.bitbucket.org/api/2.0/users/tutorials"
        }

        ```


        The rel for this link is self and the href is
        https://api.bitbucket.org/api/2.0/users/tutorials. A single rel key can
        contain an list (array) of href objects. Your client should anticipate
        that any rel key can contain one or more href objects.


        Finally, links can also contain optional elements. Two common optional
        elements are the name element and the title element. They are often used
        to disambiguate links that share the same rel key. In the example below,
        the repository object that contains a clone link with two href objects.
        Each object contains the optional name element to clarify its use.


        ```json

        "links": {
          "self": {
            "href": "https://api.bitbucket.org/2.0/repositories/evzijst/bitbucket"
          },
          "clone": [
            {
              "href": "https://api.bitbucket.org/evzijst/bitbucket.git",
              "name": "https"
            },
            {
              "href": "ssh://git@bitbucket.org/erik/bitbucket.git",
              "name": "ssh"
            }
          ],
          ...
        }

        ```

        Links can support [URI Templates](https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc6570);
        Those that do contain a `"templated": "true"` element.

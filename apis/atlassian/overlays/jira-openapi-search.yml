        Combinations of custom field and issue should be unique within the
        request.


        Apps can only perform this operation on [custom
        fields](https://developer.atlassian.com/platform/forge/manifest-reference/modules/jira-custom-field/)
        and [custom field
        types](https://developer.atlassian.com/platform/forge/manifest-reference/modules/jira-custom-field-type/)
        declared in their own manifests.


        **[Permissions](#permissions) required:** Only the app that owns the
        custom field or custom field type can update its values with this
        operation.

        created by a [Forge
        app](https://developer.atlassian.com/platform/forge/).


        The result can be filtered by one of these criteria:

         *  `id`.
         *  `fieldContextId`.
         *  `issueId`.
         *  `projectKeyOrId` and `issueTypeId`.

        Otherwise, all configurations are returned.

        A dashboard item enables an app to add user-specific information to a
        user dashboard. Dashboard items are exposed to users as gadgets that
        users can add to their dashboards. For more information on how users do
        this, see [Adding and customizing
        gadgets](https://confluence.atlassian.com/x/7AeiLQ).


        When an app creates a dashboard item it registers a callback to receive
        the dashboard item ID. The callback fires whenever the item is rendered
        or, where the item is configurable, the user edits the item. The app
        then uses this resource to store the item's content or configuration
        details. For more information on working with dashboard items, see [
        Building a dashboard item for a JIRA Connect

  /rest/api/3/expression/eval:
    post:

        Evaluates a Jira expression and returns its value.


        This resource can be used to test Jira expressions that you plan to use
        elsewhere, or to fetch data in a flexible way. Consult the [Jira
        expressions
        documentation](https://developer.atlassian.com/cloud/jira/platform/jira-expressions/)
        for more details.


        #### Context variables ####


        The following context variables are available to Jira expressions
        evaluated by this resource. Their presence depends on various factors;
        usually you need to manually request them in the context object sent in
        the payload, but some of them are added automatically under certain
        conditions.

         *  `user` ([User](https://developer.atlassian.com/cloud/jira/platform/jira-expressions-type-reference#user)): The current user. Always available and equal to `null` if the request is anonymous.
         *  `app` ([App](https://developer.atlassian.com/cloud/jira/platform/jira-expressions-type-reference#app)): The [Connect app](https://developer.atlassian.com/cloud/jira/platform/index/#connect-apps) that made the request. Available only for authenticated requests made by Connect Apps (read more here: [Authentication for Connect apps](https://developer.atlassian.com/cloud/jira/platform/security-for-connect-apps/)).
         *  `issue` ([Issue](https://developer.atlassian.com/cloud/jira/platform/jira-expressions-type-reference#issue)): The current issue. Available only when the issue is provided in the request context object.
         *  `issues` ([List](https://developer.atlassian.com/cloud/jira/platform/jira-expressions-type-reference#list) of [Issues](https://developer.atlassian.com/cloud/jira/platform/jira-expressions-type-reference#issue)): A collection of issues matching a JQL query. Available only when JQL is provided in the request context object.
         *  `project` ([Project](https://developer.atlassian.com/cloud/jira/platform/jira-expressions-type-reference#project)): The current project. Available only when the project is provided in the request context object.
         *  `sprint` ([Sprint](https://developer.atlassian.com/cloud/jira/platform/jira-expressions-type-reference#sprint)): The current sprint. Available only when the sprint is provided in the request context object.
         *  `board` ([Board](https://developer.atlassian.com/cloud/jira/platform/jira-expressions-type-reference#board)): The current board. Available only when the board is provided in the request context object.
         *  `serviceDesk` ([ServiceDesk](https://developer.atlassian.com/cloud/jira/platform/jira-expressions-type-reference#servicedesk)): The current service desk. Available only when the service desk is provided in the request context object.
         *  `customerRequest` ([CustomerRequest](https://developer.atlassian.com/cloud/jira/platform/jira-expressions-type-reference#customerrequest)): The current customer request. Available only when the customer request is provided in the request context object.

        Also, custom context variables can be passed in the request with their
        types. Those variables can be accessed by key in the Jira expression.
        These variable types are available for use in a custom context:

         *  `user`: A [user](https://developer.atlassian.com/cloud/jira/platform/jira-expressions-type-reference#user) specified as an Atlassian account ID.
         *  `issue`: An [issue](https://developer.atlassian.com/cloud/jira/platform/jira-expressions-type-reference#issue) specified by ID or key. All the fields of the issue object are available in the Jira expression.
         *  `json`: A JSON object containing custom content.
         *  `list`: A JSON list of `user`, `issue`, or `json` variable types.

        This operation can be accessed anonymously.


        **[Permissions](#permissions) required**: None. However, an expression
        may return different results for different users depending on their
        permissions. For example, different users may see different comments on
        the same issue.  

        Permission to access Jira Software is required to access Jira Software
        context variables (`board` and `sprint`) or fields (for example,
        `issue.sprint`).

        If `projectIds` is empty, a global context is created. A global context
        is one that applies to all project. If `issueTypeIds` is empty, the
        context applies to all issue types.

         *  `CustomFieldContextDefaultValueCascadingOption` (type `option.cascading`) for cascading select lists.
         *  `CustomFieldContextSingleUserPickerDefaults` (type `single.user.select`) for single users.
         *  `CustomFieldContextDefaultValueMultiUserPicker` (type `multi.user.select`) for user lists.
         *  `CustomFieldContextDefaultValueSingleGroupPicker` (type `grouppicker.single`) for single choice group pickers.
         *  `CustomFieldContextDefaultValueMultipleGroupPicker` (type `grouppicker.multiple`) for multiple choice group pickers.
         *  `CustomFieldContextDefaultValueURL` (type `url`) for URLs.
         *  `CustomFieldContextDefaultValueProject` (type `project`) for project pickers.
         *  `CustomFieldContextDefaultValueFloat` (type `float`) for floats (floating-point numbers).
         *  `CustomFieldContextDefaultValueLabels` (type `labels`) for labels.
         *  `CustomFieldContextDefaultValueTextField` (type `textfield`) for text fields.
         *  `CustomFieldContextDefaultValueTextArea` (type `textarea`) for text area fields.
         *  `CustomFieldContextDefaultValueReadOnly` (type `readonly`) for read only (text) fields.
         *  `CustomFieldContextDefaultValueMultipleVersion` (type `version.multiple`) for single choice version pickers.
         *  `CustomFieldContextDefaultValueSingleVersion` (type `version.single`) for multiple choice version pickers.

        Forge custom fields
        [types](https://developer.atlassian.com/platform/forge/manifest-reference/modules/jira-custom-field-type/#data-types)
        are also supported, returning:

         *  `CustomFieldContextDefaultValueForgeMultiStringFieldBean` (type `forge.string.list`) for Forge string collection fields.
         *  `CustomFieldContextDefaultValueForgeObjectFieldBean` (type `forge.object`) for Forge object fields.
         *  `CustomFieldContextDefaultValueForgeDateTimeFieldBean` (type `forge.datetime`) for Forge date-time fields.
         *  `CustomFieldContextDefaultValueForgeGroupFieldBean` (type `forge.group`) for Forge group fields.
         *  `CustomFieldContextDefaultValueForgeMultiGroupFieldBean` (type `forge.group.list`) for Forge group collection fields.
         *  `CustomFieldContextDefaultValueForgeNumberFieldBean` (type `forge.number`) for Forge number fields.
         *  `CustomFieldContextDefaultValueForgeUserFieldBean` (type `forge.user`) for Forge user fields.
         *  `CustomFieldContextDefaultValueForgeMultiUserFieldBean` (type `forge.user.list`) for Forge user collection fields.

        If there is no custom field context assigned to the project then, if
        present, the custom field context that applies to all projects is
        returned if it also applies to the issue type or all issue types. If a

        A custom field context without any issue types applies to all issue
        types. Adding issue types to such a custom field context would result in
        it applying to only the listed issue types.


        If any of the issue types exists in the custom field context, the
        operation fails and no issue types are added.

        A custom field context without any projects applies to all projects.
        Removing all projects from a custom field context would result in it
        applying to all projects.


        If any project in the request is not assigned to the context, or the
        operation would result in two global contexts for the field, the
        operation fails.

        Deselects an issue-field select-list option from all issues where it is
        selected. A different option can be selected to replace the deselected
        option. The update can also be limited to a smaller set of issues by
        using a JQL query.


        Connect and Forge app users with *Administer Jira* [global
        permission](https://confluence.atlassian.com/x/x4dKLg) can override the
        screen security configuration using `overrideScreenSecurity` and
        `overrideEditableFlag`.

        options added by Connect apps**, it cannot be used with issue field
        select list options created in Jira or using operations from the [Issue
        custom field options](#api-group-Issue-custom-field-options) resource.

        Removes a filter as a favorite for the user. Note that this operation
        only removes filters visible to the user from the user's favorites list.
        For example, if the user favorites a public filter that is subsequently
        made private (and is therefore no longer visible on their favorites
        list) they cannot remove it from their favorites list.

  /rest/api/3/groups/picker:
    get:
      description: >-
        Returns a list of groups whose names contain a query string. A list of
        group names can be provided to exclude groups from the results.


        The primary use case for this resource is to populate a group picker
        suggestions list. To this end, the returned object includes the `html`
        field where the matched query term is highlighted in the group name with
        the HTML strong tag. Also, the groups list is wrapped in a response
        object that contains a header for use in the picker, specifically
        *Showing X of Y matching groups*.


        The list returns with the groups sorted. If no groups match the list
        criteria, an empty list is returned.


        This operation can be accessed anonymously.


        **[Permissions](#permissions) required:** *Browse projects* [project
        permission](https://confluence.atlassian.com/x/yodKLg). Anonymous calls
        and calls by users without the required permission return an empty list.


        *Browse users and groups* [global
        permission](https://confluence.atlassian.com/x/x4dKLg). Without this
        permission, calls where query is not an exact match to an existing group
        will return an empty list.

  /rest/api/3/groupuserpicker:
    get:
      description: >-
        Returns a list of users and groups matching a string. The string is
        used:

         *  for users, to find a case-insensitive match with display name and e-mail address. Note that if a user has hidden their email address in their user profile, partial matches of the email address will not find the user. An exact match is required.
         *  for groups, to find a case-sensitive match with group name.

        For example, if the string *tin* is used, records with the display name
        *Tina*, email address *sarah@tinplatetraining.com*, and the group
        *accounting* would be returned.


        Optionally, the search can be refined to:

         *  the projects and issue types associated with a custom field, such as a user picker. The search can then be further refined to return only users and groups that have permission to view specific:
            
             *  projects.
             *  issue types.
            
            If multiple projects or issue types are specified, they must be a subset of those enabled for the custom field or no results are returned. For example, if a field is enabled for projects A, B, and C then the search could be limited to projects B and C. However, if the search is limited to projects B and D, nothing is returned.
         *  not return Connect app users and groups.
         *  return groups that have a case-insensitive match with the query.

        The primary use case for this resource is to populate a picker field
        suggestion list with users or groups. To this end, the returned object
        includes an `html` field for each list. This field highlights the
        matched query term in the item name with the HTML strong tag. Also, each
        list is wrapped in a response object that contains a header for use in a
        picker, specifically *Showing X of Y matching groups*.


        This operation can be accessed anonymously.

        Creates an issue or, where the option to create subtasks is enabled in
        Jira, a subtask. A transition may be applied, to move the issue or
        subtask to a workflow step other than the default start step, and issue
        properties set.


        The content of the issue or subtask is defined using `update` and
        `fields`. The fields that can be set in the issue or subtask are
        determined using the [ Get create issue
        metadata](#api-rest-api-3-issue-createmeta-get). These are the same
        fields that appear on the issue's create screen. Note that the
        `description`, `environment`, and any `textarea` type custom fields
        (multi-line text fields) take Atlassian Document Format content. Single
        line custom fields (`textfield`) accept a string and don't handle
        Atlassian Document Format content.


        Creating a subtask differs from creating an issue as follows:

         *  `issueType` must be set to a subtask issue type (use [ Get create issue metadata](#api-rest-api-3-issue-createmeta-get) to find subtask issue types).
         *  `parent` must contain the ID or key of the parent issue.

        In a next-gen project any issue may be made a child providing that the
        parent and child are members of the same project.


        **[Permissions](#permissions) required:** *Browse projects* and *Create
        issues* [project permissions](https://confluence.atlassian.com/x/yodKLg)
        for the project in which the issue or subtask is created.

        `fields`. The fields that can be set in the issue or subtask are
        determined using the [ Get create issue
        metadata](#api-rest-api-3-issue-createmeta-get). These are the same
        fields that appear on the issues' create screens. Note that the
        `description`, `environment`, and any `textarea` type custom fields
        (multi-line text fields) take Atlassian Document Format content. Single
        line custom fields (`textfield`) accept a string and don't handle
        Atlassian Document Format content.


        Creating a subtask differs from creating an issue as follows:

         *  `issueType` must be set to a subtask issue type (use [ Get create issue metadata](#api-rest-api-3-issue-createmeta-get) to find subtask issue types).
         *  `parent` the must contain the ID or key of the parent issue.

        **[Permissions](#permissions) required:** *Browse projects* and *Create
        issues* [project permissions](https://confluence.atlassian.com/x/yodKLg)
        for the project in which each issue or subtask is created.

      description: >-
        Deletes a property value from multiple issues. The issues to be updated
        can be specified by filter criteria.


        The criteria the filter used to identify eligible issues are:

         *  `entityIds` Only issues from this list are eligible.
         *  `currentValue` Only issues with the property set to this value are eligible.

        If both criteria is specified, they are joined with the logical *AND*:
        only issues that satisfy both criteria are considered eligible.


        If no filter criteria are specified, all the issues visible to the user
        and where the user has the EDIT\_ISSUES permission for the issue are
        considered eligible.


        This operation is:

         *  transactional, either the property is deleted from all eligible issues or, when errors occur, no properties are deleted.
         *  [asynchronous](#async). Follow the `location` link in the response to determine the status of the task and use [Get task](#api-rest-api-3-task-taskId-get) to obtain subsequent updates.

        Sets a property value on multiple issues.


        The value set can be a constant or determined by a [Jira
        expression](https://developer.atlassian.com/cloud/jira/platform/jira-expressions/).
        Expressions must be computable with constant complexity when applied to
        a set of issues. Expressions must also comply with the
        [restrictions](https://developer.atlassian.com/cloud/jira/platform/jira-expressions/#restrictions)
        that apply to all Jira expressions.


        The issues to be updated can be specified by a filter.


        The filter identifies issues eligible for update using these criteria:

         *  `entityIds` Only issues from this list are eligible.
         *  `currentValue` Only issues with the property set to this value are eligible.
         *  `hasProperty`:
            
             *  If *true*, only issues with the property are eligible.
             *  If *false*, only issues without the property are eligible.

        If more than one criteria is specified, they are joined with the logical
        *AND*: only issues that satisfy all criteria are eligible.


        If an invalid combination of criteria is provided, an error is returned.
        For example, specifying a `currentValue` and `hasProperty` as *false*
        would not match any issues (because without the property the property
        cannot have a value).


        The filter is optional. Without the filter all the issues visible to the
        user and where the user has the EDIT\_ISSUES permission for the issue
        are considered eligible.


        This operation is:

         *  transactional, either all eligible issues are updated or, when errors occur, none are updated.
         *  [asynchronous](#async). Follow the `location` link in the response to determine the status of the task and use [Get task](#api-rest-api-3-task-taskId-get) to obtain subsequent updates.

        **[Permissions](#permissions) required:**

         *  *Browse projects* [project permission](https://confluence.atlassian.com/x/yodKLg) for each project containing issues.
         *  If [issue-level security](https://confluence.atlassian.com/x/J4lKLg) is configured, issue-level security permission to view the issue.

        An issue cannot be deleted if it has one or more subtasks. To delete an
        issue with subtasks, set `deleteSubtasks`. This causes the issue's
        subtasks to be deleted with the issue.

        Returns the details for an issue.


        The issue is identified by its ID or key, however, if the identifier
        doesn't match an issue, a case-insensitive search and check for moved
        issues is performed. If a matching issue is found its details are
        returned, a 302 or other redirect is **not** returned. The issue key
        returned in the response is the key of the issue found.

        Edits an issue. A transition may be applied and issue properties updated
        as part of the edit.


        The edits to the issue's fields are defined using `update` and `fields`.
        The fields that can be edited are determined using [ Get edit issue
        metadata](#api-rest-api-3-issue-issueIdOrKey-editmeta-get).


        The parent field may be set by key or ID. For standard issue types, the
        parent may be removed by setting `update.parent.set.none` to *true*.
        Note that the `description`, `environment`, and any `textarea` type
        custom fields (multi-line text fields) take Atlassian Document Format
        content. Single line custom fields (`textfield`) accept a string and
        don't handle Atlassian Document Format content.

        Note that:

         *  The request must have a `X-Atlassian-Token: no-check` header, if not it is blocked. See [Special headers](#special-request-headers) for more information.
         *  The name of the multipart/form-data parameter that contains the attachments must be `file`.

             // https://developer.atlassian.com/platform/forge/
             // https://www.npmjs.com/package/form-data
             import api from "@forge/api";
             import FormData from "form-data";
            
             const form = new FormData();
             form.append('file', fileStream, {knownLength: fileSizeInBytes});
            
             const response = await api.asApp().requestJira('/rest/api/2/issue/{issueIdOrKey}/attachments', {
                 method: 'POST',
                 body: form,
                 headers: {
                     'Accept': 'application/json',
                     'X-Atlassian-Token': 'no-check'
                 }
             });
            
             console.log(`Response: ${response.status} ${response.statusText}`);
             console.log(await response.json());

        Tip: Use a client library. Many client libraries have classes for
        handling multipart POST operations. For example, in Java, the Apache
        HTTP Components library provides a
        [MultiPartEntity](http://hc.apache.org/httpcomponents-client-ga/httpmime/apidocs/org/apache/http/entity/mime/MultipartEntity.html)
        class for multipart POST operations.

  /rest/api/3/issue/{issueIdOrKey}/editmeta:
    get:
      description: >-
        Returns the edit screen fields for an issue that are visible to and
        editable by the user. Use the information to populate the requests in
        [Edit issue](#api-rest-api-3-issue-issueIdOrKey-put).


        This endpoint will check for these conditions:


        1.  Field is available on a field screen - through screen, screen
        scheme, issue type screen scheme, and issue type scheme configuration.
        `overrideScreenSecurity=true` skips this condition.

        2.  Field is visible in the [field
        configuration](https://support.atlassian.com/jira-cloud-administration/docs/change-a-field-configuration/).
        `overrideScreenSecurity=true` skips this condition.

        3.  Field is shown on the issue: each field has different conditions
        here. For example: Attachment field only shows if attachments are
        enabled. Assignee only shows if user has permissions to assign the
        issue.

        4.  If a field is custom then it must have valid custom field context,
        applicable for its project and issue type. All system fields are assumed
        to have context in all projects and all issue types.

        5.  Issue has a project, issue type, and status defined.

        6.  Issue is assigned to a valid workflow, and the current status has
        assigned a workflow step. `overrideEditableFlag=true` skips this
        condition.

        7.  The current workflow step is editable. This is true by default, but
        [can be disabled by
        setting](https://support.atlassian.com/jira-cloud-administration/docs/use-workflow-properties/)
        the `jira.issue.editable` property to `false`.
        `overrideEditableFlag=true` skips this condition.

        8.  User has [Edit issues
        permission](https://support.atlassian.com/jira-cloud-administration/docs/permissions-for-company-managed-projects/).

        9.  Workflow permissions allow editing a field. This is true by default
        but [can be
        modified](https://support.atlassian.com/jira-cloud-administration/docs/use-workflow-properties/)
        using `jira.permission.*` workflow properties.


        Fields hidden using [Issue layout settings
        page](https://support.atlassian.com/jira-software-cloud/docs/configure-field-layout-in-the-issue-view/)
        remain editable.


        Connect apps having an app user with *Administer Jira* [global
        permission](https://confluence.atlassian.com/x/x4dKLg), and Forge apps
        acting on behalf of users with *Administer Jira* [global
        permission](https://confluence.atlassian.com/x/x4dKLg), can return
        additional details using:

         *  `overrideScreenSecurity` When this flag is `true`, then this endpoint skips checking if fields are available through screens, and field configuration (conditions 1. and 2. from the list above).
         *  `overrideEditableFlag` When this flag is `true`, then this endpoint skips checking if workflow is present and if the current step is editable (conditions 6. and 7. from the list above).

        This operation can be accessed anonymously.


        **[Permissions](#permissions) required:**

         *  *Browse projects* [project permission](https://confluence.atlassian.com/x/yodKLg) for the project that the issue is in.
         *  If [issue-level security](https://confluence.atlassian.com/x/J4lKLg) is configured, issue-level security permission to view the issue.

        Note: For any fields to be editable the user must have the *Edit issues*
        [project permission](https://confluence.atlassian.com/x/yodKLg) for the
        issue.

        Only issue security levels in the context of classic projects are
        returned.


        Filtering using IDs is inclusive: if you specify both security scheme
        IDs and level IDs, the result will include both specified issue security
        levels and all issue security levels from the specified schemes.

  /rest/api/3/issuetype/{id}/avatar2:
    post:
      description: >-
        Loads an avatar for the issue type.


        Specify the avatar's local file location in the body of the request.
        Also, include the following headers:

         *  `X-Atlassian-Token: no-check` To prevent XSRF protection blocking the request, for more information see [Special Headers](#special-request-headers).
         *  `Content-Type: image/image type` Valid image types are JPEG, GIF, or PNG.

        For example:  

        `curl --request POST \ --user email@example.com:<api_token> \ --header
        'X-Atlassian-Token: no-check' \ --header 'Content-Type: image/<
        image_type>' \ --data-binary "<@/path/to/file/with/your/avatar>" \ --url
        'https://your-domain.atlassian.net/rest/api/3/issuetype/{issueTypeId}'This`


        The avatar is cropped to a square. If no crop parameters are specified,
        the square originates at the top left of the image. The length of the
        square's sides is set to the smaller of the height or width of the
        image.


        The cropped image is then used to create avatars of 16x16, 24x24, 32x32,
        and 48x48 in size.


        After creating the avatar, use [ Update issue
        type](#api-rest-api-3-issuetype-id-put) to set it as the issue type's
        displayed avatar.

        Assigns an issue type scheme to a project.


        If any issues in the project are assigned issue types not present in the
        new scheme, the operation will fail. To complete the assignment those
        issues must be updated to use issue types in the new scheme.


        Issue type schemes can only be assigned to classic projects.

        This operation can filter the custom fields returned by project. Invalid
        project IDs in `projectIds` are ignored. System fields are always
        returned.


        It can also return the collapsed field for custom fields. Collapsed
        fields enable searches to be performed across all fields with the same
        name and of the same field type. For example, the collapsed field
        `Component - Component[Dropdown]` enables dropdown fields `Component -
        cf[10061]` and `Component - cf[10062]` to be searched simultaneously.

  /rest/api/3/jql/sanitize:
    post:
      description: >-
        Sanitizes one or more JQL queries by converting readable details into
        IDs where a user doesn't have permission to view the entity.


        For example, if the query contains the clause *project = 'Secret
        project'*, and a user does not have browse permission for the project
        "Secret project", the sanitized query replaces the clause with *project
        = 12345"* (where 12345 is the ID of the project). If a user has the
        required permission, the clause is not sanitized. If the account ID is
        null, sanitizing is performed for an anonymous user.


        Note that sanitization doesn't make the queries GDPR-compliant, because
        it doesn't remove user identifiers (username or user key). If you need
        to make queries GDPR-compliant, use [Convert user identifiers to account
        IDs in JQL
        queries](https://developer.atlassian.com/cloud/jira/platform/rest/v3/api-group-jql/#api-rest-api-3-jql-sanitize-post).


        Before sanitization each JQL query is parsed. The queries are returned
        in the same order that they were passed.


        **[Permissions](#permissions) required:** *Administer Jira* [global
        permission](https://confluence.atlassian.com/x/x4dKLg).

  /rest/api/3/mypermissions:
    get:
      description: >-
        Returns a list of permissions indicating which permissions the user has.
        Details of the user's permissions can be obtained in a global, project,
        issue or comment context.


        The user is reported as having a project permission:

         *  in the global context, if the user has the project permission in any project.
         *  for a project, where the project permission is determined using issue data, if the user meets the permission's criteria for any issue in the project. Otherwise, if the user has the project permission in the project.
         *  for an issue, where a project permission is determined using issue data, if the user has the permission in the issue. Otherwise, if the user has the project permission in the project containing the issue.
         *  for a comment, where the user has both the permission to browse the comment and the project permission for the comment's parent issue. Only the BROWSE\_PROJECTS permission is supported. If a `commentId` is provided whose `permissions` does not equal BROWSE\_PROJECTS, a 400 error will be returned.

        This means that users may be shown as having an issue permission (such
        as EDIT\_ISSUES) in the global context or a project context but may not
        have the permission for any or all issues. For example, if Reporters
        have the EDIT\_ISSUES permission a user would be shown as having this
        permission in the global context or the context of a project, because
        any user can be a reporter. However, if they are not the user who
        reported the issue queried they would not have EDIT\_ISSUES permission
        for that issue.


        Global permissions are unaffected by context.


        This operation can be accessed anonymously.


        **[Permissions](#permissions) required:** None.

        Creates a preference for the user or updates a preference's value by
        sending a plain text string. For example, `false`. An arbitrary
        preference can be created with the value containing up to 255
        characters. In addition, the following keys define system preferences
        that can be set or created:

         *  *user.notifications.mimetype* The mime type used in notifications sent to the user. Defaults to `html`.
         *  *user.default.share.private* Whether new [ filters](https://confluence.atlassian.com/x/eQiiLQ) are set to private. Defaults to `true`.
         *  *user.keyboard.shortcuts.disabled* Whether keyboard shortcuts are disabled. Defaults to `false`.
         *  *user.autowatch.disabled* Whether the user automatically watches issues they create or add a comment to. By default, not set: the user takes the instance autowatch setting.

        Note that these keys are deprecated:

         *  *jira.user.locale* The locale of the user. By default, not set. The user takes the instance locale.
         *  *jira.user.timezone* The time zone of the user. By default, not set. The user takes the instance timezone.

        These system preferences keys will be deprecated by 15/07/2024. You can

         *  *user.notifiy.own.changes* Whether the user gets notified of their own changes.
         *  *user.notifications.watcher* Whether the user gets notified when they are watcher.
         *  *user.notifications.assignee* Whether the user gets notified when they are assignee.

        If the user has no language preference set (which is the default
        setting) or this resource is accessed anonymous, the browser locale
        detected by Jira is returned. Jira detects the browser locale using the
        *Accept-Language* header in the request. However, if this doesn't match
        a locale available Jira, the site default locale is returned.


        This operation can be accessed anonymously.


        **[Permissions](#permissions) required:** None.

        notification scheme assigned. You can provide either one or multiple
        notification scheme IDs or project IDs to filter by. If you don't
        provide any, this will return a list of all mappings. Note that only
        company-managed (classic) projects are supported. This is because
        team-managed projects don't have a concept of a default notification
        scheme. The mappings are ordered by projectId.

        permission](https://confluence.atlassian.com/x/x4dKLg) to check the
        permissions for other users, otherwise none. However, Connect apps can
        make a call from the app server to the product to obtain permission
        details for any user, without admin permission. This Connect app ability
        doesn't apply to calls made using AP.request() in a browser.

        ### About permission schemes and grants ###


        A permission scheme is a collection of permission grants. A permission
        grant consists of a `holder` and a `permission`.


        #### Holder object ####


        The `holder` object contains information about the user or group being
        granted the permission. For example, the *Administer projects*
        permission is granted to a group named *Teams in space administrators*.
        In this case, the type is `"type": "group"`, and the parameter is the
        group name, `"parameter": "Teams in space administrators"` and the value
        is group ID, `"value": "ca85fac0-d974-40ca-a615-7af99c48d24f"`.


        The `holder` object is defined by the following properties:

         *  `type` Identifies the user or group (see the list of types below).
         *  `parameter` As a group's name can change, use of `value` is recommended. The value of this property depends on the `type`. For example, if the `type` is a group, then you need to specify the group name.
         *  `value` The value of this property depends on the `type`. If the `type` is a group, then you need to specify the group ID. For other `type` it has the same value as `parameter`

        The following `types` are available. The expected values for `parameter`
        and `value` are given in parentheses (some types may not have a
        `parameter` or `value`):

         *  `anyone` Grant for anonymous users.
         *  `applicationRole` Grant for users with access to the specified application (application name, application name). See [Update product access settings](https://confluence.atlassian.com/x/3YxjL) for more information.
         *  `assignee` Grant for the user currently assigned to an issue.
         *  `group` Grant for the specified group (`parameter` : group name, `value` : group ID).
         *  `groupCustomField` Grant for a user in the group selected in the specified custom field (`parameter` : custom field ID, `value` : custom field ID).
         *  `projectLead` Grant for a project lead.
         *  `projectRole` Grant for the specified project role (`parameter` :project role ID, `value` : project role ID).
         *  `reporter` Grant for the user who reported the issue.
         *  `sd.customer.portal.only` Jira Service Desk only. Grants customers permission to access the customer portal but not Jira. See [Customizing Jira Service Desk permissions](https://confluence.atlassian.com/x/24dKLg) for more information.
         *  `user` Grant for the specified user (`parameter` : user ID - historically this was the userkey but that is deprecated and the account ID should be used, `value` : user ID).
         *  `userCustomField` Grant for a user selected in the specified custom field (`parameter` : custom field ID, `value` : custom field ID).

        #### Built-in permissions ####


        The [built-in Jira
        permissions](https://confluence.atlassian.com/x/yodKLg) are listed
        below. Apps can also define custom permissions. See the [project
        permission](https://developer.atlassian.com/cloud/jira/platform/modules/project-permission/)
        and [global
        permission](https://developer.atlassian.com/cloud/jira/platform/modules/global-permission/)

        Updates a permission scheme. Below are some important things to note
        when using this resource:

         *  If a permissions list is present in the request, then it is set in the permission scheme, overwriting *all existing* grants.
         *  If you want to update only the name and description, then do not send a permissions list in the request.
         *  Sending an empty list will remove all permission grants from the permission scheme.

        If you want to add or delete a permission grant instead of updating the
        whole list, see [Create permission
        grant](#api-rest-api-3-permissionscheme-schemeId-permission-post) or
        [Delete permission scheme
        entity](#api-rest-api-3-permissionscheme-schemeId-permission-permissionId-delete).


        See [About permission schemes and
        grants](../api-group-permission-schemes/#about-permission-schemes-and-grants)
        for more details.


        **[Permissions](#permissions) required:** *Administer Jira* [global
        permission](https://confluence.atlassian.com/x/x4dKLg).

        Returns a [paginated](#pagination) list of priorities. The list can
        contain all priorities or a subset determined by any combination of
        these criteria:

         *  a list of priority IDs. Any invalid priority IDs are ignored.
         *  a list of project IDs. Only priorities that are available in these projects will be returned. Any invalid project IDs are ignored.
         *  whether the field configuration is a default. This returns priorities from company-managed (classic) projects only, as there is no concept of default priorities in team-managed projects.

  /rest/api/3/project/{projectIdOrKey}/avatar2:
    post:
      description: >-
        Loads an avatar for a project.


        Specify the avatar's local file location in the body of the request.
        Also, include the following headers:

         *  `X-Atlassian-Token: no-check` To prevent XSRF protection blocking the request, for more information see [Special Headers](#special-request-headers).
         *  `Content-Type: image/image type` Valid image types are JPEG, GIF, or PNG.

        For example:  

        `curl --request POST `


        `--user email@example.com:<api_token> `


        `--header 'X-Atlassian-Token: no-check' `


        `--header 'Content-Type: image/< image_type>' `


        `--data-binary "<@/path/to/file/with/your/avatar>" `


        `--url
        'https://your-domain.atlassian.net/rest/api/3/project/{projectIdOrKey}/avatar2'`


        The avatar is cropped to a square. If no crop parameters are specified,
        the square originates at the top left of the image. The length of the
        square's sides is set to the smaller of the height or width of the
        image.


        The cropped image is then used to create avatars of 16x16, 24x24, 32x32,
        and 48x48 in size.


        After creating the avatar use [Set project
        avatar](#api-rest-api-3-project-projectIdOrKey-avatar-put) to set it as
        the project's displayed avatar.

        Deletes a project asynchronously.


        This operation is:

        Get the issue type hierarchy for a next-gen project.


        The issue type hierarchy for a project consists of:

         *  *Epic* at level 1 (optional).
         *  One or more issue types at level 0 such as *Story*, *Task*, or *Bug*. Where the issue type *Epic* is defined, these issue types are used to break down the content of an epic.
         *  *Subtask* at level -1 (optional). This issue type enables level 0 issue types to be broken down into components. Issues based on a level -1 issue type must have a parent issue.

        **[Permissions](#permissions) required:** *Browse projects* [project
        permission](https://confluence.atlassian.com/x/yodKLg) for the project.

        Returns a [paginated](#pagination) list of resolutions. The list can
        contain all resolutions or a subset determined by any combination of
        these criteria:

         *  a list of resolutions IDs.
         *  whether the field configuration is a default. This returns resolutions from company-managed (classic) projects only, as there is no concept of default resolutions in team-managed projects.

    get:
      description: >-
        Gets a list of all project roles, complete with project role details and
        default actors.


        ### About project roles ###


        [Project
        roles](https://support.atlassian.com/jira-cloud-administration/docs/manage-project-roles/)
        are a flexible way to to associate users and groups with projects. In
        Jira Cloud, the list of project roles is shared globally with all
        projects, but each project can have a different set of actors associated
        with it (unlike groups, which have the same membership throughout all
        Jira applications).


        Project roles are used in [permission
        schemes](#api-rest-api-3-permissionscheme-get), [email notification
        schemes](#api-rest-api-3-notificationscheme-get), [issue security
        levels](#api-rest-api-3-issuesecurityschemes-get), [comment
        visibility](#api-rest-api-3-comment-list-post), and workflow conditions.


        #### Members and actors ####


        In the Jira REST API, a member of a project role is called an *actor*.
        An *actor* is a group or user associated with a project role.


        Actors may be set as [default
        members](https://support.atlassian.com/jira-cloud-administration/docs/manage-project-roles/#Specifying-'default-members'-for-a-project-role)
        of the project role or set at the project level:

         *  Default actors: Users and groups that are assigned to the project role for all newly created projects. The default actors can be removed at the project level later if desired.
         *  Actors: Users and groups that are associated with a project role for a project, which may differ from the default actors. This enables you to assign a user to different roles in different projects.

        **[Permissions](#permissions) required:** *Administer Jira* [global
        permission](https://confluence.atlassian.com/x/x4dKLg).

        Creates a new project role with no [default

        actors to project role](#api-rest-api-3-role-id-actors-post) operation
        to add default actors to the project role after creating it.


        *Note that although a new project role is available to all projects upon
        creation, any default actors that are associated with the project role
        are not added to projects that existed prior to the role being
        created.*<

        You cannot update both the name and description at the same time using
        this operation. If you send a request with a name and a description only
        the name is updated.

        Searches for IDs of issues using

        Use the [Search](#api-rest-api-3-search-post) endpoint if you need to
        fetch more than just issue IDs. The Search endpoint returns more
        information, but may take much longer to respond to requests. This is
        because it uses a different mechanism for ordering results than this
        endpoint and doesn't provide the total number of results for your query.

        Sets the default issue navigator columns.


        The `columns` parameter accepts a navigable field value and is expressed
        as HTML form data. To specify multiple columns, pass multiple `columns`
        parameters. For example, in curl:


        `curl -X PUT -d columns=summary -d columns=description
        https://your-domain.atlassian.net/rest/api/3/settings/columns`


        If no column details are sent, then all default columns are removed.


        A navigable field is one that can be used as a column on the issue
        navigator. Find details of navigable issue columns using [Get
        fields](#api-rest-api-3-field-get).

        Each app can define up to 3000 UI modifications. Each UI modification
        can define up to 1000 contexts. The same context can be assigned to
        maximum 100 UI modifications.


        **[Permissions](#permissions) required:**

         *  *None* if the UI modification is created without contexts.
         *  *Browse projects* [project permission](https://confluence.atlassian.com/x/yodKLg) for one or more projects, if the UI modification is created with contexts.

        Loads a custom avatar for a project or issue type.


        Specify the avatar's local file location in the body of the request.
        Also, include the following headers:

         *  `X-Atlassian-Token: no-check` To prevent XSRF protection blocking the request, for more information see [Special Headers](#special-request-headers).
         *  `Content-Type: image/image type` Valid image types are JPEG, GIF, or PNG.

        For example:  

        `curl --request POST `


        `--user email@example.com:<api_token> `


        `--header 'X-Atlassian-Token: no-check' `


        `--header 'Content-Type: image/< image_type>' `


        `--data-binary "<@/path/to/file/with/your/avatar>" `


        `--url
        'https://your-domain.atlassian.net/rest/api/3/universal_avatar/type/{type}/owner/{entityId}'`


        The avatar is cropped to a square. If no crop parameters are specified,
        the square originates at the top left of the image. The length of the
        square's sides is set to the smaller of the height or width of the
        image.


        The cropped image is then used to create avatars of 16x16, 24x24, 32x32,
        and 48x48 in size.


        After creating the avatar use:

         *  [Update issue type](#api-rest-api-3-issuetype-id-put) to set it as the issue type's displayed avatar.
         *  [Set project avatar](#api-rest-api-3-project-projectIdOrKey-avatar-put) to set it as the project's displayed avatar.

        **[Permissions](#permissions) required:** *Administer Jira* [global
        permission](https://confluence.atlassian.com/x/x4dKLg).

  /rest/api/3/user/assignable/multiProjectSearch:
    get:
      description: >-
        Returns a list of users who can be assigned issues in one or more
        projects. The list may be restricted to users whose attributes match a
        string.


        This operation takes the users in the range defined by `startAt` and
        `maxResults`, up to the thousandth user, and then returns only the users
        from that range that can be assigned issues in the projects. This means
        the operation usually returns fewer users than specified in
        `maxResults`. To get all the users who can be assigned issues in the
        projects, use [Get all users](#api-rest-api-3-users-search-get) and
        filter the records in your code.


        Privacy controls are applied to the response based on the users'
        preferences. This could mean, for example, that the user's email address
        is hidden. See the [Profile visibility
        overview](https://developer.atlassian.com/cloud/jira/platform/profile-visibility/)
        for more details.


        This operation can be accessed anonymously.

  /rest/api/3/user/assignable/search:
    get:
      description: >-
        Returns a list of users that can be assigned to an issue. Use this
        operation to find the list of users who can be assigned to:

         *  a new issue, by providing the `projectKeyOrId`.
         *  an updated issue, by providing the `issueKey`.
         *  to an issue during a transition (workflow action), by providing the `issueKey` and the transition id in `actionDescriptorId`. You can obtain the IDs of an issue's valid transitions using the `transitions` option in the `expand` parameter of [ Get issue](#api-rest-api-3-issue-issueIdOrKey-get).

        In all these cases, you can pass an account ID to determine if a user
        can be assigned to an issue. The user is returned in the response if
        they can be assigned to the issue or issue transition.


        This operation takes the users in the range defined by `startAt` and
        `maxResults`, up to the thousandth user, and then returns only the users
        from that range that can be assigned the issue. This means the operation
        usually returns fewer users than specified in `maxResults`. To get all
        the users who can be assigned the issue, use [Get all
        users](#api-rest-api-3-users-search-get) and filter the records in your
        code.


        Privacy controls are applied to the response based on the users'

  /rest/api/3/user/permission/search:
    get:
      description: >-
        Returns a list of users who fulfill these criteria:

         *  their user attributes match a search string.
         *  they have a set of permissions for a project or issue.

        If no search string is provided, a list of all users with the
        permissions is returned.


        This operation takes the users in the range defined by `startAt` and
        `maxResults`, up to the thousandth user, and then returns only the users
        from that range that match the search string and have permission for the
        project or issue. This means the operation usually returns fewer users
        than specified in `maxResults`. To get all the users who match the
        search string and have permission for the project or issue, use [Get all
        users](#api-rest-api-3-users-search-get) and filter the records in your
        code.


        Privacy controls are applied to the response based on the users'
        preferences. This could mean, for example, that the user's email address
        is hidden. See the [Profile visibility
        overview](https://developer.atlassian.com/cloud/jira/platform/profile-visibility/)
        for more details.


        This operation can be accessed anonymously.


        **[Permissions](#permissions) required:**

         *  *Administer Jira* [global permission](https://confluence.atlassian.com/x/x4dKLg), to get users for any project.
         *  *Administer Projects* [project permission](https://confluence.atlassian.com/x/yodKLg) for a project, to get users for that project.

  /rest/api/3/user/picker:
    get:
      description: >-
        Returns a list of users whose attributes match the query term. The
        returned object includes the `html` field where the matched query term
        is highlighted with the HTML strong tag. A list of account IDs can be
        provided to exclude users from the results.


        This operation takes the users in the range defined by `maxResults`, up
        to the thousandth user, and then returns only the users from that range
        that match the query term. This means the operation usually returns
        fewer users than specified in `maxResults`. To get all the users who
        match the query term, use [Get all
        users](#api-rest-api-3-users-search-get) and filter the records in your
        code.


        Privacy controls are applied to the response based on the users'
        preferences. This could mean, for example, that the user's email address
        is hidden. See the [Profile visibility
        overview](https://developer.atlassian.com/cloud/jira/platform/profile-visibility/)
        for more details.


        This operation can be accessed anonymously.


        **[Permissions](#permissions) required:** *Browse users and groups*
        [global permission](https://confluence.atlassian.com/x/x4dKLg).
        Anonymous calls and calls by users without the required permission

        Returns a list of active users that match the search string and

        This operation first applies a filter to match the search string and
        property, and then takes the filtered users in the range defined by
        `startAt` and `maxResults`, up to the thousandth user. To get all the
        users who match the search string and property, use [Get all
        users](#api-rest-api-3-users-search-get) and filter the records in your
        code.


        This operation can be accessed anonymously.


        Privacy controls are applied to the response based on the users'
        preferences. This could mean, for example, that the user's email address
        is hidden. See the [Profile visibility
        overview](https://developer.atlassian.com/cloud/jira/platform/profile-visibility/)

  /rest/api/3/user/search/query:
    get:
      description: >-
        Finds users with a structured query and returns a
        [paginated](#pagination) list of user details.


        This operation takes the users in the range defined by `startAt` and
        `maxResults`, up to the thousandth user, and then returns only the users
        from that range that match the structured query. This means the
        operation usually returns fewer users than specified in `maxResults`. To
        get all the users who match the structured query, use [Get all
        users](#api-rest-api-3-users-search-get) and filter the records in your
        code.


        **[Permissions](#permissions) required:** *Browse users and groups*
        [global permission](https://confluence.atlassian.com/x/x4dKLg).


        The query statements are:

         *  `is assignee of PROJ` Returns the users that are assignees of at least one issue in project *PROJ*.
         *  `is assignee of (PROJ-1, PROJ-2)` Returns users that are assignees on the issues *PROJ-1* or *PROJ-2*.
         *  `is reporter of (PROJ-1, PROJ-2)` Returns users that are reporters on the issues *PROJ-1* or *PROJ-2*.
         *  `is watcher of (PROJ-1, PROJ-2)` Returns users that are watchers on the issues *PROJ-1* or *PROJ-2*.
         *  `is voter of (PROJ-1, PROJ-2)` Returns users that are voters on the issues *PROJ-1* or *PROJ-2*.
         *  `is commenter of (PROJ-1, PROJ-2)` Returns users that have posted a comment on the issues *PROJ-1* or *PROJ-2*.
         *  `is transitioner of (PROJ-1, PROJ-2)` Returns users that have performed a transition on issues *PROJ-1* or *PROJ-2*.
         *  `[propertyKey].entity.property.path is "property value"` Returns users with the entity property value.

        The list of issues can be extended as needed, as in *(PROJ-1, PROJ-2,
        ... PROJ-n)*. Statements can be combined using the `AND` and `OR`
        operators to form more complex queries. For example:


        `is assignee of PROJ AND [propertyKey].entity.property.path is "property
        value"`

  /rest/api/3/user/search/query/key:
    get:
      description: >-
        Finds users with a structured query and returns a
        [paginated](#pagination) list of user keys.


        This operation takes the users in the range defined by `startAt` and
        `maxResults`, up to the thousandth user, and then returns only the users
        from that range that match the structured query. This means the
        operation usually returns fewer users than specified in `maxResults`. To
        get all the users who match the structured query, use [Get all
        users](#api-rest-api-3-users-search-get) and filter the records in your
        code.


        **[Permissions](#permissions) required:** *Browse users and groups*
        [global permission](https://confluence.atlassian.com/x/x4dKLg).


        The query statements are:

         *  `is assignee of PROJ` Returns the users that are assignees of at least one issue in project *PROJ*.
         *  `is assignee of (PROJ-1, PROJ-2)` Returns users that are assignees on the issues *PROJ-1* or *PROJ-2*.
         *  `is reporter of (PROJ-1, PROJ-2)` Returns users that are reporters on the issues *PROJ-1* or *PROJ-2*.
         *  `is watcher of (PROJ-1, PROJ-2)` Returns users that are watchers on the issues *PROJ-1* or *PROJ-2*.
         *  `is voter of (PROJ-1, PROJ-2)` Returns users that are voters on the issues *PROJ-1* or *PROJ-2*.
         *  `is commenter of (PROJ-1, PROJ-2)` Returns users that have posted a comment on the issues *PROJ-1* or *PROJ-2*.
         *  `is transitioner of (PROJ-1, PROJ-2)` Returns users that have performed a transition on issues *PROJ-1* or *PROJ-2*.
         *  `[propertyKey].entity.property.path is "property value"` Returns users with the entity property value.

        The list of issues can be extended as needed, as in *(PROJ-1, PROJ-2,
        ... PROJ-n)*. Statements can be combined using the `AND` and `OR`
        operators to form more complex queries. For example:


        `is assignee of PROJ AND [propertyKey].entity.property.path is "property
        value"`

        Returns a list of users who fulfill these criteria:

         *  their user attributes match a search string.

        Use this resource to find users who can browse:

         *  an issue, by providing the `issueKey`.
         *  any issue in a project, by providing the `projectKey`.

        This operation takes the users in the range defined by `startAt` and

        Privacy controls are applied to the response based on the users'
        preferences. This could mean, for example, that the user's email address

        Alternative versions can be provided to update issues that use the
        deleted version in `fixVersion`, `affectedVersion`, or any version
        picker custom fields. If alternatives are not provided, occurrences of
        `fixVersion`, `affectedVersion`, and any version picker custom field,
        that contain the deleted version, are cleared. Any replacement version
        must be in the same project as the version being deleted and cannot be
        the version being deleted.


        This operation can be accessed anonymously.

        the failure time of the last webhook on the list as the `failedAfter`
        value or use the URL provided in `next`.


        **[Permissions](#permissions) required:** Only [Connect
        apps](https://developer.atlassian.com/cloud/jira/platform/index/#connect-apps)
        can use this operation.

      description: >-
        Creates a workflow. You can define transition rules using the shapes
        detailed in the following sections. If no transitional rules are
        specified the default system transition rules are used. Note: This only
        applies to company-managed scoped workflows. Use [bulk create
        workflows](https://developer.atlassian.com/cloud/jira/platform/rest/v3/api-group-workflows/#api-rest-api-3-workflows-create-post)
        to create both team and company-managed scoped workflows.


        #### Conditions ####


        Conditions enable workflow rules that govern whether a transition can
        execute.


        ##### Always false condition #####


        A condition that always fails.

            {
               "type": "AlwaysFalseCondition"
             }

        ##### Block transition until approval #####


        A condition that blocks issue transition if there is a pending approval.

            {
               "type": "BlockInProgressApprovalCondition"
             }

        ##### Compare number custom field condition #####


        A condition that allows transition if a comparison between a number
        custom field and a value is true.

            {
               "type": "CompareNumberCFCondition",
               "configuration": {
                 "comparator": "=",
                 "fieldId": "customfield_10029",
                 "fieldValue": 2
               }
             }

         *  `comparator` One of the supported comparator: `=`, `>`, and `<`.
         *  `fieldId` The custom numeric field ID. Allowed field types:
            
             *  `com.atlassian.jira.plugin.system.customfieldtypes:float`
             *  `com.pyxis.greenhopper.jira:jsw-story-points`
         *  `fieldValue` The value for comparison.

        ##### Hide from user condition #####


        A condition that hides a transition from users. The transition can only
        be triggered from a workflow function or REST API operation.

            {
               "type": "RemoteOnlyCondition"
             }

        ##### Only assignee condition #####


        A condition that allows only the assignee to execute a transition.

            {
               "type": "AllowOnlyAssignee"
             }

        ##### Only Bamboo notifications workflow condition (deprecated) #####


        A condition that makes the transition available only to Bamboo build
        notifications.

            {
               "type": "OnlyBambooNotificationsCondition"

        app can be updated.


        To assist with app migration, this operation can be used to:

         *  Disable a rule.
         *  Add a `tag`. Use this to filter rules in the [Get workflow transition rule configurations](https://developer.atlassian.com/cloud/jira/platform/rest/v3/api-group-workflow-transition-rules/#api-rest-api-3-workflow-rule-config-get).

        Rules are enabled if the `disabled` parameter is not provided.

    get:
      description: >-
        Get the list of workflow capabilities for a specific workflow using
        either the workflow ID, or the project and issue type ID pair. The
        response includes the scope of the workflow, defined as
        global/project-based, and a list of project types that the workflow is
        scoped to. It also includes all rules organised into their broad
        categories (conditions, validators, actions, triggers, screens) as well
        as the source location (Atlassian-provided, Connect, Forge).


        **[Permissions](#permissions) required:**

         *  *Administer Jira* project permission to access all, including global-scoped, workflows
         *  *Administer projects* project permissions to access project-scoped workflows

        The current list of Atlassian-provided rules:


        #### Validators ####


        A validator rule that checks if a user has the required permissions to
        execute the transition in the workflow.


        ##### Permission validator #####


        A validator rule that checks if a user has the required permissions to
        execute the transition in the workflow.

            {
               "ruleKey": "system:check-permission-validator",
               "parameters": {
                 "permissionKey": "ADMINISTER_PROJECTS"
               }
             }

        Parameters:

         *  `permissionKey` The permission required to perform the transition. Allowed values: [built-in Jira permissions](https://developer.atlassian.com/cloud/jira/platform/rest/v3/api-group-permission-schemes/#built-in-permissions).

        ##### Parent or child blocking validator #####


        A validator to block the child issue\\u2019s transition depending on the
        parent issue\\u2019s status.

            {
               "ruleKey" : "system:parent-or-child-blocking-validator"
               "parameters" : {
                 "blocker" : "PARENT"
                 "statusIds" : "1,2,3"
               }
             }

        Parameters:

         *  `blocker` currently only supports `PARENT`.
         *  `statusIds` a comma-separated list of status IDs.

        ##### Previous status validator #####


        A validator that checks if an issue has transitioned through specified
        previous status(es) before allowing the current transition to occur.

            {
               "ruleKey": "system:previous-status-validator",
               "parameters": {
                 "previousStatusIds": "10014",
                 "mostRecentStatusOnly": "true"
               }
             }

        Parameters:

         *  `previousStatusIds` a comma-separated list of status IDs, currently only support one ID.
         *  `mostRecentStatusOnly` when `true` only considers the most recent status for the condition evaluation. Allowed values: `true`, `false`.

        ##### Validate a field value #####


        A validation that ensures a specific field's value meets the defined
        criteria before allowing an issue to transition in the workflow.


        Depending on the rule type, the result will vary:


        ###### Field required ######

        execute.


        ##### Check field value #####


        A condition rule evaluates as true if a specific field's value meets the
        defined criteria. This rule ensures that an issue can only transition to
        the next step in the workflow if the field's value matches the desired
        condition.

            {
               "ruleKey": "system:check-field-value",

        Returns a list of the workflow schemes associated with a list of
        projects. Each returned workflow scheme includes a list of the requested
        projects associated with it. Any team-managed or non-existent projects
        in the request are ignored and no errors are returned.


        If the project is associated with the `Default Workflow Scheme` no ID is
        returned. This is because the way the `Default Workflow Scheme` is
        stored means it has no ID.

        scheme are immediately available. When changing the available statuses

        defined in the provided mappings.

        Resets the default workflow for a workflow scheme. That is, the default
        workflow is set to Jira's system workflow (the *jira* workflow).


        Note that active workflow schemes cannot be edited. If the workflow
        scheme is active, set `updateDraftIfNeeded` to `true` and a draft
        workflow scheme is created or updated with the default workflow reset.
        The draft workflow scheme can be published in Jira.

        Note that active workflow schemes cannot be edited. If the workflow
        scheme is active, set `updateDraftIfNeeded` to `true` in the request
        object and a draft workflow scheme is created or updated with the new
        default workflow. The draft workflow scheme can be published in Jira.

        Returns the draft workflow scheme for an active workflow scheme. Draft
        workflow schemes allow changes to be made to the active workflow
        schemes: When an active workflow scheme is updated, a draft copy is
        created. The draft is modified, then the changes in the draft are copied
        back to the active workflow scheme. See [Configuring workflow
        schemes](https://confluence.atlassian.com/x/tohKLg) for more
        information.  

        Note that:

         *  Only active workflow schemes can have draft workflow schemes.
         *  An active workflow scheme can only have one draft workflow scheme.

        Note that active workflow schemes cannot be edited. If the workflow
        scheme is active, set `updateDraftIfNeeded` to `true` and a draft
        workflow scheme is created or updated with the issue type-workflow
        mapping deleted. The draft workflow scheme can be published in Jira.

        Sets the issue types for a workflow in a workflow scheme. The workflow
        can also be set as the default workflow for the workflow scheme.
        Unmapped issues types are mapped to the default workflow.


        Note that active workflow schemes cannot be edited. If the workflow
        scheme is active, set `updateDraftIfNeeded` to `true` in the request
        body and a draft workflow scheme is created or updated with the new
        workflow-issue types mappings. The draft workflow scheme can be
        published in Jira.

        Returns a list of IDs and delete timestamps for worklogs deleted after a

        This resource is paginated, with a limit of 1000 worklogs per page. Each
        page lists worklogs from oldest to youngest. If the number of items in
        the date range exceeds 1000, `until` indicates the timestamp of the
        youngest item on the page. Also, `nextPage` provides the URL for the
        next page of worklogs. The `lastPage` parameter is set to true on the
        last page of worklogs.


        This resource does not return worklogs deleted during the minute

    get:
      description: >-
        Returns a list of IDs and update timestamps for worklogs updated after a
        date and time.


        This resource is paginated, with a limit of 1000 worklogs per page. Each
        page lists worklogs from oldest to youngest. If the number of items in
        the date range exceeds 1000, `until` indicates the timestamp of the
        youngest item on the page. Also, `nextPage` provides the URL for the
        next page of worklogs. The `lastPage` parameter is set to true on the
        last page of worklogs.


        This resource does not return worklogs updated during the minute
        preceding the request.


        **[Permissions](#permissions) required:** Permission to access Jira,
        however, worklogs are only returned where either of the following is
        true:

         *  the worklog is set as *Viewable by All Users*.
         *  the user is a member of a project role or group with permission to view the worklog.

      ### About notification schemes ###


      A notification scheme is a list of events and recipients who will receive
      notifications for those events. The list is contained within the
      `notificationSchemeEvents` object and contains pairs of `events` and
      `notifications`:

       *  `event` Identifies the type of event. The events can be [Jira system events](https://support.atlassian.com/jira-cloud-administration/docs/configure-notification-schemes/) (see the *Events* section) or [custom events](https://support.atlassian.com/jira-cloud-administration/docs/add-a-custom-event/).
       *  `notifications` Identifies the [recipients](https://confluence.atlassian.com/x/8YdKLg#Creatinganotificationscheme-recipientsRecipients) of notifications for each event. Recipients can be any of the following types:
          
           *  `CurrentAssignee`
           *  `Reporter`
           *  `CurrentUser`
           *  `ProjectLead`
           *  `ComponentLead`
           *  `User` (the `parameter` is the user key)
           *  `Group` (the `parameter` is the group name)
           *  `ProjectRole` (the `parameter` is the project role ID)
           *  `EmailAddress` *(deprecated)*
           *  `AllWatchers`
           *  `UserCustomField` (the `parameter` is the ID of the custom field)
           *  `GroupCustomField`(the `parameter` is the ID of the custom field)

      security scheme or a list of issue security schemes.


      Issue security schemes control which users or groups of users can view an
      issue. When an issue security scheme is associated with a project, its
      security levels can be applied to issues in that project. Sub-tasks also
      inherit the security level of their parent issue.

      ### About issue security schemes ###


      Issue security schemes control which users or groups of users can view an
      issue. An issue security scheme is made up of multiple security levels.
      Each level can have users or groups of users assigned to it. The following
      are valid security level members:

       *  Individual users
       *  Groups of users
       *  Project roles
       *  Issue roles
       *  "Anyone", for example to allow anonymous access
       *  A (multi-)user or (multi-)group picker custom field

        ### Forge apps


        For Forge apps, [REST API
        scopes](https://developer.atlassian.com/cloud/jira/platform/scopes-for-oauth-2-3LO-and-forge-apps/) 

        are used when authenticating with Jira Cloud platform. See [Add scopes
        to call an Atlassian REST
        API](https://developer.atlassian.com/platform/forge/add-scopes-to-call-an-atlassian-rest-api/)
        for more details.


        The URIs for Forge app REST API calls have this structure:


        `/rest/api/3/<resource-name>`


        For example, `/rest/api/3/issue/DEMO-1`


        ### Connect apps


        For Connect apps, authentication (JWT-based) is built into the Connect
        libraries. Authorization is implemented using either 

        scopes (shown as _App scope required_ for operations on this page) or
        user impersonation. See 

        [Security for Connect
        apps](https://developer.atlassian.com/cloud/jira/platform/security-for-connect-apps/) 

        for details.


        The URIs for Connect app REST API calls have this structure:


        `https://<site-url>/rest/api/3/<resource-name>`


        For example, `https://your-domain.atlassian.net/rest/api/3/issue/DEMO-1`


        ### Other integrations


        For integrations that are not Forge or Connect apps, use OAuth 2.0
        authorization code grants (3LO) for security 

        (3LO scopes are shown as for operations _OAuth scopes required_). See 

        [OAuth 2.0 (3LO)
        apps](https://developer.atlassian.com/cloud/jira/platform/oauth-2-3lo-apps/) 

        for details.


        The URIs for OAuth 2.0 (3LO) app REST API calls have this structure:


        `https://api.atlassian.com/ex/jira/<cloudId>/rest/api/3/<resource-name>`


        For example,
        `https://api.atlassian.com/ex/jira/35273b54-3f06-40d2-880f-dd28cf8daafa/rest/api/3/issue/DEMO-1`


        ### Ad-hoc API calls


        For personal scripts, bots, and ad-hoc execution of the REST APIs use
        basic authentication. See [Basic auth for REST
        APIs](https://developer.atlassian.com/cloud/jira/platform/basic-auth-for-rest-apis/)
        for details. 


        The URIs for basic authentication REST API calls have this structure:


        `https://<site-url>/rest/api/3/<resource-name>`


        For example, `https://your-domain.atlassian.net/rest/api/3/issue/DEMO-1`
      title: Authentication and authorization
    - anchor: permissions
      body: >
        ### Operation permissions


        Most operations in this API require permissions. The calling user must
        have the required permissions for an operation to 

        use it. Note that for Connect apps, the app user must have the required
        permissions for the operation and the app must 

        have scopes that permit the operation.


        A permission can be granted to a group, project role, or issue role that
        the user is a member of, or granted directly to a user. 

        See [Permissions overview](https://confluence.atlassian.com/x/FQiiLQ)
        for details. The most common permissions are:


        - **Administer the Cloud site**: Users in the _site-admins_ group have
        this 

        permission. See [Manage
        groups](https://confluence.atlassian.com/x/24xjL) for details.

        - **Administer Jira**: Granted by the _Jira Administrators_ global
        permission. There is a default group for this permission. 

        See [Manage groups](https://confluence.atlassian.com/x/24xjL) and
        [Managing global permissions](https://confluence.atlassian.com/x/x4dKLg)
        for details.

        - **Administer a project in Jira**: Granted by the _Administer projects_
        project permission for a project. This can be

        ### Anonymous access


        Some operations provide support for anonymous access. However, anonymous
        access is only available if 

        the Jira permission needed to access the object or records returned by
        the operation is granted to 

        the _Public_ group. See [Allowing anonymous access to your
        project](https://confluence.atlassian.com/x/GDxxLg) 

        for details.


        If an operation is called anonymously and anonymous access is not
        available, the operation will return 

        an error. Note that not all operations that correspond to objects that
        can be given public access 

        provide for anonymous access.

    - anchor: expansion
      body: >+
        ### Expansion


        The Jira REST API uses resource expansion, which means that some parts
        of a resource are not returned unless specified 

        in the request. This simplifies responses and minimizes network traffic.


        To expand part of a resource in a request, use the expand query
        parameter and specify the object(s) to be expanded. 

        If you need to expand nested objects, use the `.` dot notation. If you
        need to expand multiple objects, use a 

        comma-separated list. 


        For example, the following request expands the `names` and
        `renderedFields` properties for the _JRACLOUD-34423_ issue:


        `GET issue/JRACLOUD-34423?expand=names,renderedFields`


        To discover which object can be expanded, refer to the `expand` property
        in the object. 

        In the JSON example below, the resource declares `widgets` as
        expandable.


        ```json

        {
          "expand": "widgets", 
          "self": "https://your-domain.atlassian.net/rest/api/3/resource/KEY-1", 
          "widgets": {
            "widgets": [],
            "size": 5
           }
        }

        ```


        ### Pagination


        The Jira REST API uses pagination to improve performance. Pagination is
        enforced for operations that could return a large 

        collection of items. When you make a request to a paginated resource,
        the response wraps the returned array of values in 

        a JSON object with paging metadata. For example:


        ```json

        {
            "startAt" : 0,
            "maxResults" : 10,
            "total": 200,
            "isLast": false,
            "values": [
                { /* result 0 */ },
                { /* result 1 */ },
                { /* result 2 */ }
            ]
        }

        ```


        *   `startAt` is the index of the first item returned in the page.

        *   `maxResults` is the maximum number of items that a page can return.
        Each operation can have a different limit for
            the number of items returned, and these limits may change without notice. To find the maximum number of items 
            that an operation could return, set `maxResults` to a large number—for example, over 1000—and if the returned value of `maxResults` is less than the requested value, the returned value is the maximum.
        *    `total` is the total number of items contained in all pages. This
        number **_may change_** as the client 

        requests the subsequent pages, therefore the client should always assume
        that the requested page can be empty. Note 

        that this property is not returned for all operations.

        *   `isLast` indicates whether the page returned is the last one. Note
        that this property is not returned for all operations.


        ### Ordering


        Some operations support ordering the elements of a response by a field.
        Check the documentation for the operation to 

        confirm whether ordering of a response is supported and which fields can
        be used. Responses are listed in ascending order 

        by default. You can change the order using the `orderby` query parameter
        with a `-` or `+` symbol. For example:


        *   `?orderBy=name` to order by `name` field ascending.

        *   `?orderBy=+name` to order by `name` field ascending.

        *   `?orderBy=-name` to order by `name` field descending.

    - anchor: timestamps
      body: >
        By default, top-level timestamps (e.g. updated and created) are returned
        in [ISO 8601](https://www.w3.org/TR/NOTE-datetime) format, in the system
        default user time zone.


        To return date time data in the logged in user's timezone, please refer
        to `renderedFields` property under the `expand` query parameter in
        relevant APIs.

    - anchor: special-request-headers
      body: >-
        The following request and response headers define important metadata for
        the Jira Cloud REST API resources.


        -   `X-Atlassian-Token` (request): Operations that accept
        multipart/form-data must include the `X-Atlassian-Token: no-check`

        header in requests. Otherwise the request is blocked by cross-site
        request forgery (CSRF/XSRF) protection.

        -   `X-Force-Accept-Language` (request): controls how the standard HTTP
        `Accept-Language` header is processed.

        By default `Accept-Language` is ignored and the response is in the
        language configured in the user's profile or,

        when no language is configured for the user, the default Jira instance
        language. For the response to recognize

        `Accept-Language` send `X-Force-Accept-Language = true` as well. If
        `Accept-Language` requests a language that Jira

        can return the response is in that language, otherwise Jira returns the
        response in the default language. If

        `Accept-Language` is not specified the response is in the default
        language.

        -   `X-AAccountId` (response): This response header contains the
        Atlassian account ID of the authenticated user.
      title: Special headers
    - anchor: anonymous-operations
      body: |2-
         Jira provides for all permissions, except the [global permission](https://confluence.atlassian.com/x/x4dKLg) Administer Jira, to be assigned to *Anyone*. Once a permission is assigned to *Anyone*, anyone knowing a project's URL is able to use the features in Jira enabled by the permission. However, the Jira REST API does not enable anonymous access for operations by default. This means that an anonymous user who may be able to perform an action through Jira, may not be able to perform the same action where it's enabled by the REST API. 

         The operations that provide anonymous access are annotated "This operation can be accessed anonymously."
      title: Anonymous operations
    - anchor: async-operations
      body: >-
        Some Jira REST API operations may trigger long-running or
        computationally expensive tasks. In these cases, the operation 

        will schedule an asynchronous task and return a `303 (See Other)`
        response, indicating the location of the queued task 

        in the `Location` header. You can query this task to get progress
        updates.


        When the task finishes, the response object will contain the `result`
        field. The content of the field is specific to the 

        operation that created the task. Refer to the operation’s documentation
        for more information.


        Note that asynchronous tasks are not guaranteed to be run in order. In
        other words, if you need your tasks to execute 

        in a certain order, you should start a task only after the prerequisite
        task(s) have finished.

    - anchor: status-codes
      body: >-
        The Jira Cloud platform REST API uses the [standard HTTP status
        codes](https://www.w3.org/Protocols/rfc2616/rfc2616-sec10.html).


        Operations that return an error status code may also return a response
        body containing details of the error or errors. 

        The schema for the response body is shown below:



        ```json

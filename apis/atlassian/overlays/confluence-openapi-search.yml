        Creates a new piece of content or publishes an existing draft.


        To publish a draft, add the `id` and `status` properties to the body of
        the request.

        Set the `id` to the ID of the draft and set the `status` to 'current'.
        When the

        request is sent, a new piece of content will be created and the metadata
        from the

        draft will be transferred into it.


        By default, the following objects are expanded: `space`, `history`,
        `version`.

        The archival process happens asynchronously.

        Use the /longtask/<taskId> REST API to get the copy task status.


        Each content ID needs to resolve to page objects that are not already in
        an archived state.

        [Advanced searching using
        CQL](https://developer.atlassian.com/cloud/confluence/advanced-searching-using-cql/).


        Example initial call:

        ```

        /wiki/rest/api/content/search?cql=type=page&limit=25

        ```


        Example response:

        ```

        {
          "results": [
            { ... },
            { ... },
            ...
            { ... }
          ],
          "limit": 25,
          "size": 25,
          ...
          "_links": {
            "base": "<url>",
            "context": "<url>",

            "self": "<url>"
          }
        }

        ```


        When additional results are available, returns `next` and `prev` URLs to
        retrieve them in subsequent calls. The URLs each contain a cursor that
        points to the appropriate set of results. Use `limit` to specify the
        number of results returned in each call.

        Example subsequent call (taken from example response):

        ```

        /wiki/rest/api/content/search?cql=type=page&limit=25&cursor=raNDoMsTRiNg

        ```

        The response to this will have a `prev` URL similar to the `next` in the
        example response.

        - If the content's type is `page`,`blogpost`, or `attachment` and its

        the content will be purged from the trash and deleted permanently. Note,

        you must also set the `status` query parameter to `trashed` in your

        This API accepts the pageTree delete request and returns a task ID.

        The delete process happens asynchronously.

         </code></pre>
         Use the `/longtask/<taskId>` REST API to get the copy task status.

        Returns a map of the direct children of a piece of content. A piece of
        content

        has different types of child content, depending on its type. These are

        the default parent-child content type relationships:


        - `page`: child content is `page`, `comment`, `attachment`

        - `blogpost`: child content is `comment`, `attachment`

        - `attachment`: child content is `comment`

        - `comment`: child content is `attachment`


        Apps can override these default relationships. Apps can also introduce

        new content types that create new parent-child content relationships.


        Note, the map will always include all child content types that are valid

        for the content. However, if the content has no instances of a child
        content

        type, the map will contain an empty array for that child content type.

        * `before` - move the page under the same parent as the target, before
        the target in the list of children

        * `after` - move the page under the same parent as the target, after the
        target in the list of children

        * `append` - move the page to be a child of the target


        Caution: This API can move pages to the top level of a space. Top-level
        pages are difficult to find in the UI

        because they do not show up in the page tree display. To avoid this,
        never use `before` or `after` positions

        when the `targetId` is a top-level page.

        Note, you must set a `X-Atlassian-Token: nocheck` header on the request

        for this method, otherwise it will be blocked. This protects against
        XSRF

        attacks, which is necessary as this method accepts multipart/form-data.


        The media type 'multipart/form-data' is defined in [RFC
        7578](https://www.ietf.org/rfc/rfc7578.txt).

        Most client libraries have classes that make it easier to implement

        multipart posts, like the
        [MultipartEntityBuilder](https://hc.apache.org/httpcomponents-client-5.1.x/current/httpclient5/apidocs/)

        Note, according to [RFC
        7578](https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc7578#section-4.5),

        in the case where the form data is text,

        the charset parameter for the "text/plain" Content-Type may be used to

        indicate the character encoding used in that part. In the case of this

        API endpoint, the `comment` body parameter should be sent with
        `type=text/plain`

        and `charset=utf-8` values. This will force the charset to be UTF-8.


        Example: This curl command attaches a file ('example.txt') to a piece of

        content (id='123') with a comment and `minorEdits`=true. If the
        'example.txt'

        file already exists, it will update it with a new version of the

        However, if the content has no instances of a descendant type, the map

        About the macro ID: When a macro is created in a new version of content,

        Confluence will generate a random ID for it, unless an ID is specified

        (by an app). The macro ID will look similar to this:
        '50884bd9-0cb8-41d5-98be-f80943c14f96'.

        The ID is then persisted as new versions of content are created, and is

        only modified by Confluence if there are conflicting IDs.


        Note, to preserve backwards compatibility this resource will also match
        on

        the hash of the macro body, even if a macro ID is found. This check will

        eventually become redundant, as macro IDs are generated for pages and

        transparently propagate out to all instances.

        Deprecated, use [Get content restriction status for group via
        groupId](https://developer.atlassian.com/cloud/confluence/rest/v1/api-group-content-restrictions/#api-wiki-rest-api-content-id-restriction-byoperation-operationkey-bygroupid-groupid-get).

        Returns whether the specified content restriction applies to a group.

        For example, if a page with `id=123` has a `read` restriction for the
        `admins` group,

        the following request will return `true`:


        `/wiki/rest/api/content/123/restriction/byOperation/read/group/admins`


        Note that a response of `true` does not guarantee that the group can
        view the page, as it does not account for

        account-inherited restrictions, space permissions, or even product
        access. For more

        information, see [Confluence
        permissions](https://confluence.atlassian.com/x/_AozKw).

        Returns whether the specified content restriction applies to a group.

        For example, if a page with `id=123` has a `read` restriction for the

        **Note that CQL input queries submitted through the
        `/wiki/rest/api/search` endpoint no longer support user-specific fields
        like `user`, `user.fullname`, `user.accountid`, and `user.userkey`.** 

        See this [deprecation
        notice](https://developer.atlassian.com/cloud/confluence/deprecation-notice-search-api/)
        for more details.


        Example initial call:

        ```

        /wiki/rest/api/search?cql=type=page&limit=25

        ```


        Example response:

        ```

        {
          "results": [
            { ... },
            { ... },
            ...
            { ... }
          ],
          "limit": 25,
          "size": 25,
          ...
          "_links": {
            "base": "<url>",
            "context": "<url>",
            "next": "/rest/api/search?cql=type=page&limit=25&cursor=raNDoMsTRiNg",
            "self": "<url>"
          }
        }

        ```


        When additional results are available, returns `next` and `prev` URLs to
        retrieve them in subsequent calls. The URLs each contain a cursor that
        points to the appropriate set of results. Use `limit` to specify the
        number of results returned in each call.


        Example subsequent call (taken from example response):

        ```

        /wiki/rest/api/search?cql=type=page&limit=25&cursor=raNDoMsTRiNg

        ```

        The response to this will have a `prev` URL similar to the `next` in the
        example response.

    - title: About
      anchor: about
      body: >-
        This is the reference for the Confluence Cloud REST API. This API is the
        primary way to get and

        modify data in Confluence Cloud, whether you are developing an app or
        any other integration.

        Use it to interact with Confluence entities, like pages and blog posts,
        spaces, users, groups,

        and more.
    - title: Authentication and authorization
      anchor: auth
      body: >-
        **Authentication:** If you are building a Cloud app, authentication is
        implemented via JWT or OAuth 2.0, depending on what you are building
        (see [Security
        overview](https://developer.atlassian.com/cloud/confluence/security-overview/)).
        Otherwise, if you are authenticating directly against the REST API, the
        REST API supports basic auth (see [Basic auth for REST
        APIs](https://developer.atlassian.com/cloud/confluence/basic-auth-for-rest-apis/)).


        **Authorization:** If you are building a Cloud app, authorization can be
        implemented by
        [scopes](https://developer.atlassian.com/cloud/confluence/scopes/) or by
        [OAuth 2.0 user
        impersonation](https://developer.atlassian.com/cloud/confluence/oauth-2-jwt-bearer-tokens-for-apps).
        Otherwise, if you are making calls directly against the REST API,
        authorization is based on the user used in the authentication process.


        See [Security
        overview](https://developer.atlassian.com/cloud/confluence/security-overview/)
        for more details on authentication and authorization.
    - title: Status codes
      anchor: status-code
      body: >-
        The Confluence REST API uses the [standard HTTP status
        codes](https://www.w3.org/Protocols/rfc2616/rfc2616-sec10.html).


        Responses that return an error status code will also return a response
        body, similar to the following:

        ```json

        {
          "statusCode": 404,
          "data": {
            "authorized": false,
            "valid": false,
            "errors": [
              {
                "message": {
                  "translation": "This is an example error message.",
                  "args": []
                }
              }
            ],
            "successful": false
          },
          "message": "This is an example error message."
        }

        ```
    - title: Using the REST API
      anchor: using
      body: >-
        **Expansion:** The Confluence REST API uses resource expansion: some
        parts of a resource are not returned unless explicitly specified. This
        simplifies responses and minimizes network traffic.


        To expand part of a resource in a request, use the `expand` query
        parameter and specify the entities to be expanded. If you need to expand
        nested entities, use the `.` dot notation. For example, the following
        request will expand information about the requested content's space and
        labels:

        ```

        GET /wiki/rest/api/content/{id}?expand=space,metadata.labels

        ```

        **Pagination:** The Confluence REST API uses pagination: a method that
        returns a response with multiple objects can only return a limited
        number at one time. This limits the size of responses and conserves
        server resources.


        Use the 'limit' and 'start' query parameters to specify pagination:


        - `limit` is the number of objects to return per page. This may be
        restricted by system limits.

        - `start` is the index of the first item returned in the page of
        results. The base index is 0.


        For example, the following request will return ten content objects,
        starting from the fifth object.

        ```

        GET /wiki/rest/api/content?start=4&limit=10

        ```

        **Special headers:**


        - `X-Atlassian-Token: no-check` request header must be specified for
        methods

        that are protected from Cross Site Request Forgery (XSRF/CSRF) attacks.
        This is

        stated in the method description, if required. For more information, see
        this

        [KB
        article](https://confluence.atlassian.com/cloudkb/xsrf-check-failed-when-calling-cloud-apis-826874382.html).
    - title: Capabilities
      anchor: capabilities
      body: >-
        **Webhooks:** A webhook is a user-defined callback over HTTP. You can
        use Confluence webhooks to notify your app or web application when
        certain events occur in Confluence. For example, when a page is created
        or updated. To learn more, see
        [Webhooks](https://developer.atlassian.com/cloud/confluence/modules/webhook/).


        **Content properties:** Content properties are a key-value storage
        associated with a piece of Confluence content. If you are building an
        app, this is one form of persistence that you can use. You can use the
        Confluence REST API to get, update, and delete content properties. To
        learn more, see [Content properties in the REST
        API](https://developer.atlassian.com/cloud/confluence/content-properties/).


        **CQL:** The Confluence Query Language (CQL) allows you to perform
        complex searches for content using an SQL-like syntax in the `search`
        resource. To learn more, see [Advanced searching using
        CQL](https://developer.atlassian.com/cloud/confluence/advanced-

  title: The Confluence Cloud REST API
  description: >-
    This document describes the REST API and resources provided by Confluence.
    The REST APIs are for developers who want to integrate Confluence into their
    application and for administrators who want to script interactions with the
    Confluence server.Confluence's REST APIs provide access to resources (data
    entities) via URI paths. To use a REST API, your application will make an
    HTTP request and parse the response. The response format is JSON. Your
    methods will be the standard HTTP methods like GET, PUT, POST and DELETE.
    Because the REST API is based on open standards, you can use any web
    development language to access the API.

        Set the `id` to the ID of the draft and set the `status` to 'current'.

        from the

        draft will be transferred into it.


        By default, the following objects are expanded: `space`, `history`,
        `version`.

        ```


        When additional results are available, returns `next` and `prev` URLs to
        retrieve them in subsequent calls. The URLs each contain a cursor that
        points to the appropriate set of results. Use `limit` to specify the
        number of results returned in each call.

        Example subsequent call (taken from example response):

        ```

        /wiki/rest/api/content/search?cql=type=page&limit=25&cursor=raNDoMsTRiNg

        The response to this will have a `prev` URL similar to the `next` in the

        - `attachment`: child content is `comment`

        - `comment`: child content is `attachment`


        Apps can override these default relationships. Apps can also introduce

        new content types that create new parent-child content relationships.


        Note, the map will always include all child content types that are valid

        for the content. However, if the content has no instances of a child
        content

        type, the map will contain an empty array for that child content type.

        Adds an attachment to a piece of content. If the attachment already
        exists

        for the content, then the attachment is updated (i.e. a new version of
        the

        attachment is created).


        Note, you must set a `X-Atlassian-Token: nocheck` header on the request

        for this method, otherwise it will be blocked. This protects against
        XSRF

        attacks, which is necessary as this method accepts multipart/form-data.


        The media type 'multipart/form-data' is defined in [RFC
        7578](https://www.ietf.org/rfc/rfc7578.txt).

        Most client libraries have classes that make it easier to implement

        multipart posts, like the
        [MultipartEntityBuilder](https://hc.apache.org/httpcomponents-client-5.1.x/current/httpclient5/apidocs/)

        Java class provided by Apache HTTP Components.


        Note, according to [RFC
        7578](https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc7578#section-4.5),

        in the case where the form data is text,

        the charset parameter for the "text/plain" Content-Type may be used to

        indicate the character encoding used in that part. In the case of this

        API endpoint, the `comment` body parameter should be sent with
        `type=text/plain`

        and `charset=utf-8` values. This will force the charset to be UTF-8.


        Example: This curl command attaches a file ('example.txt') to a piece of

        content (id='123') with a comment and `minorEdits`=true. If the
        'example.txt'

        file already exists, it will update it with a new version of the
        attachment.


        ``` bash

        curl -D- \
          -u admin:admin \
          -X PUT \
          -H 'X-Atlassian-Token: nocheck' \

      summary: Update attachment data
      description: >-
        Updates the binary data of an attachment, given the attachment ID, and

        optionally the comment and the minor edit field.


        This method is essentially the same as [Create or update
        attachments](#api-content-id-child-attachment-put),

        except that it matches the attachment ID rather than the name.


        Note, you must set a `X-Atlassian-Token: nocheck` header on the request

        for this method, otherwise it will be blocked. This protects against
        XSRF

        attacks, which is necessary as this method accepts multipart/form-data.


        The media type 'multipart/form-data' is defined in [RFC
        7578](https://www.ietf.org/rfc/rfc7578.txt).

        Most client libraries have classes that make it easier to implement

        multipart posts, like the
        [MultipartEntityBuilder](https://hc.apache.org/httpcomponents-client-5.1.x/current/httpclient5/apidocs/)

        Java class provided by Apache HTTP Components.


        Note, according to [RFC
        7578](https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc7578#section-4.5),

        in the case where the form data is text,

        the charset parameter for the "text/plain" Content-Type may be used to

        indicate the character encoding used in that part. In the case of this

        API endpoint, the `comment` body parameter should be sent with
        `type=text/plain`

        and `charset=utf-8` values. This will force the charset to be UTF-8.


        Example: This curl command updates an attachment (id='att456') that is
        attached

        to a piece of content (id='123') with a comment and `minorEdits`=true.


        ``` bash

        curl -D- \
          -u admin:admin \
          -X POST \
          -H 'X-Atlassian-Token: nocheck' \
          -F 'file=@"example.txt"' \
          -F 'minorEdit="true"' \
          -F 'comment="Example attachment comment"; type=text/plain; charset=utf-8' \
          http://myhost/rest/api/content/123/child/attachment/att456/data
        ```

        Returns all children of a given type, for a piece of content.

        A piece of content has different types of child content, depending on
        its type:


        - `page`: child content is `page`, `comment`, `attachment`

        - `blogpost`: child content is `comment`, `attachment`

        - `attachment`: child content is `comment`

        - `comment`: child content is `attachment`


        Custom content types that are provided by apps can also be returned.


        Note, this method only returns direct children. To return children at
        all

      description: >-
        Returns a map of the descendants of a piece of content. This is similar

        to [Get content children](#api-content-id-child-get), except that this

        method returns child pages at all levels, rather than just the direct

        child pages.


        A piece of content has different types of descendants, depending on its
        type:


        - `page`: descendant is `page`, `comment`, `attachment`

        - `blogpost`: descendant is `comment`, `attachment`

        - `attachment`: descendant is `comment`

        - `comment`: descendant is `attachment`


        The map will always include all descendant types that are valid for the
        content.

        However, if the content has no instances of a descendant type, the map
        will

        contain an empty array for that descendant type.

        About the macro ID: When a macro is created in a new version of content,

        Confluence will generate a random ID for it, unless an ID is specified

        (by an app). The macro ID will look similar to this:

        The ID is then persisted as new versions of content are created, and is

        only modified by Confluence if there are conflicting IDs.


        Note, to preserve backwards compatibility this resource will also match
        on

        the hash of the macro body, even if a macro ID is found. This check will

        eventually become redundant, as macro IDs are generated for pages and

        transparently propagate out to all instances.

        About the macro ID: When a macro is created in a new version of content,

        Confluence will generate a random ID for it, unless an ID is specified

        (by an app). The macro ID will look similar to this:
        '884bd9-0cb8-41d5-98be-f80943c14f96'.

        The ID is then persisted as new versions of content are created, and is

        only modified by Confluence if there are conflicting IDs.


        Note, to preserve backwards compatibility this resource will also match
        on

        the hash of the macro body, even if a macro ID is found. This check will

        eventually become redundant, as macro IDs are generated for pages and

        transparently propagate out to all instances.

        Removes a label from a piece of content. Labels can't be deleted from
        archived content.

        This is similar to [Remove label from content using query
        parameter](#api-content-id-label-delete)

        except that the label name is specified via a path parameter.


        Use this method if the label name does not have "/" characters, as the

        parameter does not accept "/" characters for security reasons.
        Otherwise,

        use [Remove label from content using query

      summary: Copy page hierarchy
      description: >-
        Copy page hierarchy allows the copying of an entire hierarchy of pages
        and their associated properties, permissions and attachments.
         The id path parameter refers to the content id of the page to copy, and the new parent of this copied page is defined using the destinationPageId in the request body.
         The titleOptions object defines the rules of renaming page titles during the copy;
         for example, search and replace can be used in conjunction to rewrite the copied page titles.

         Response example:
         <pre><code>
         {
              "id" : "1180606",
              "links" : {
                   "status" : "/rest/api/longtask/1180606"
              }
         }
         </code></pre>
         Use the /longtask/<taskId> REST API to get the copy task status.

        Returns whether the specified content restriction applies to a group.

        For example, if a page with `id=123` has a `read` restriction for the
        `admins` group,

        the following request will return `true`:


        `/wiki/rest/api/content/123/restriction/byOperation/read/group/admins`


        Note that a response of `true` does not guarantee that the group can
        view the page, as it does not account for

        account-inherited restrictions, space permissions, or even product
        access. For more

        points to the appropriate set of results. Use `limit` to specify the
        number of results returned in each call.


        Example subsequent call (taken from example response):

        ```

        /wiki/rest/api/search?cql=type=page&limit=25&cursor=raNDoMsTRiNg

        ```

        The response to this will have a `prev` URL similar to the `next` in the
        example response.

        A multi-value parameter indicating which properties of the content to
        expand and populate. Expands are dependent on the

        `to` conversion format and may be irrelevant for certain conversions
        (e.g. `macroRenderedOutput` is redundant when

        converting to `view` format). 


        If rendering to `view` format, and the body content being converted
        includes arbitrary nested content (such as macros); then it is 

        necessary to include webresource expands in the request. Webresources

        as html `<script>` tags

        - `webresource.superbatch.tags.css` returns all common CSS dependencies
        as html `<style>` tags

        - `webresource.superbatch.tags.js` returns all common dependencies as
        html `<script>` and `<style>` tags

        - `webresource.uris.js` returns JS dependencies specific to conversion

        - `webresource.uris.css` returns CSS dependencies specific to conversion

        associated restrictions.

        - `restrictions.update.restrictions.user` returns the users that have
        permission to update the content.

        - `restrictions.update.restrictions.group` returns the groups that have

    - title: About
      anchor: about
      body: >-
        This is the reference for the Confluence Cloud REST API. This API is the
        primary way to get and

        modify data in Confluence Cloud, whether you are developing an app or
        any other integration.

        Use it to interact with Confluence entities, like pages and blog posts,
        spaces, users, groups,

        and more.
    - title: Authentication and authorization
      anchor: auth
      body: >-
        **Authentication:** If you are building a Cloud app, authentication is
        implemented via JWT or OAuth 2.0, depending on what you are building
        (see [Security
        overview](https://developer.atlassian.com/cloud/confluence/security-overview/)).
        Otherwise, if you are authenticating directly against the REST API, the
        REST API supports basic auth (see [Basic auth for REST
        APIs](https://developer.atlassian.com/cloud/confluence/basic-auth-for-rest-apis/)).


        **Authorization:** If you are building a Cloud app, authorization can be
        implemented by
        [scopes](https://developer.atlassian.com/cloud/confluence/scopes/) or by
        [OAuth 2.0 user
        impersonation](https://developer.atlassian.com/cloud/confluence/oauth-2-jwt-bearer-tokens-for-apps).
        Otherwise, if you are making calls directly against the REST API,
        authorization is based on the user used in the authentication process.


        See [Security
        overview](https://developer.atlassian.com/cloud/confluence/security-overview/)
        for more details on authentication and authorization.
    - title: Status codes
      anchor: status-code
      body: >-
        The Confluence REST API uses the [standard HTTP status
        codes](https://www.w3.org/Protocols/rfc2616/rfc2616-sec10.html).


        Responses that return an error status code will also return a response
        body, similar to the following:

        ```json

        {
          "statusCode": 404,
          "data": {
            "authorized": false,
            "valid": false,
            "errors": [
              {
                "message": {
                  "translation": "This is an example error message.",
                  "args": []
                }
              }
            ],
            "successful": false
          },
          "message": "This is an example error message."
        }

        ```
    - title: Using the REST API
      anchor: using
      body: >-
        **Expansion:** The Confluence REST API uses resource expansion: some
        parts of a resource are not returned unless explicitly specified. This
        simplifies responses and minimizes network traffic.


        To expand part of a resource in a request, use the `expand` query
        parameter and specify the entities to be expanded. If you need to expand
        nested entities, use the `.` dot notation. For example, the following
        request will expand information about the requested content's space and
        labels:

        ```

        GET /wiki/rest/api/content/{id}?expand=space,metadata.labels

        ```

        **Pagination:** The Confluence REST API uses pagination: a method that
        returns a response with multiple objects can only return a limited
        number at one time. This limits the size of responses and conserves
        server resources.


        Use the 'limit' and 'start' query parameters to specify pagination:


        - `limit` is the number of objects to return per page. This may be
        restricted by system limits.

        - `start` is the index of the first item returned in the page of
        results. The base index is 0.


        For example, the following request will return ten content objects,
        starting from the fifth object.

        ```

        GET /wiki/rest/api/content?start=4&limit=10

        ```

        **Special headers:**


        - `X-Atlassian-Token: no-check` request header must be specified for
        methods

        that are protected from Cross Site Request Forgery (XSRF/CSRF) attacks.
        This is

        stated in the method description, if required. For more information, see
        this

        [KB
        article](https://confluence.atlassian.com/cloudkb/xsrf-check-failed-when-calling-cloud-apis-826874382.html).
    - title: Capabilities
      anchor: capabilities
      body: >-
        **Webhooks:** A webhook is a user-defined callback over HTTP. You can
        use Confluence webhooks to notify your app or web application when
        certain events occur in Confluence. For example, when a page is created
        or updated. To learn more, see
        [Webhooks](https://developer.atlassian.com/cloud/confluence/modules/webhook/).


        **Content properties:** Content properties are a key-value storage
        associated with a piece of Confluence content. If you are building an
        app, this is one form of persistence that you can use. You can use the
        Confluence REST API to get, update, and delete content properties. To
        learn more, see [Content properties in the REST
        API](https://developer.atlassian.com/cloud/confluence/content-properties/).


        **CQL:** The Confluence Query Language (CQL) allows you to perform
        complex searches for content using an SQL-like syntax in the `search`
        resource. To learn more, see [Advanced searching using
        CQL](https://developer.atlassian.com/cloud/confluence/advanced-searching-using-cql/).
